// SingleInstanceLockID is the Wails SingleInstanceLock UniqueId — the single
// identity all c0wrk processes agree on for "the one running instance". It is
// deliberately the macOS bundle identifier (com.wails.{{.Name}} from
// build/darwin/Info.plist with wails.json name=c0wrk-desktop): LaunchServices
// resolves a notification-banner activation to the bundle, so keying the
// single-instance identity to the same string keeps the two notions of "this
// app" aligned. Platform derivations of the id (lockfile name on darwin,
// session-bus name on Linux, mutex/window class on Windows) are built by the
// Wails frontends; keep this in sync with the bundle id if it ever changes.
//
// See ADR-075 (single-instance lock) and issue #98.

// SingleInstanceOptions builds the Wails v2 SingleInstanceLock option wired
// into options.App by main.go. The option is what turns a LaunchServices-
// spawned second process (macOS notification-banner click against a stale or
// rebuilt bundle registration — issue #98's failure mode) into a relay: the
// second process detects the first instance's platform lock, forwards its
// launch data, and exits at the very start of the Wails frontend Run — before
// a window is created, before OnStartup opens the database, before any
// watcher or PTY exists. The first instance receives the data through
// App.handleSecondInstanceLaunch and focuses its window.
//
// The handler is deliberately an UNEXPORTED method wrapped here: Wails binds
// every exported method of the structs in options.App.Bind to the frontend,
// exempting only the four lifecycle hooks (OnStartup/OnShutdown/OnDomReady/
// OnBeforeClose), and a frontend-callable "focus the window" binding is
// surface nobody needs.

// handleSecondInstanceLaunch is the OnSecondInstanceLaunch callback: a second
// c0wrk process started (on macOS typically LaunchServices activating the app
// from a delivered notification banner whose bundle registration no longer
// matches the running process — a rebuilt .app, an updater-swapped install
// tree, or a stale LaunchServices registration) and is exiting after handing
// us its launch data. The only thing this path can do for the user is bring
// the running window forward: the notification's routing context (session/
// project ids) is delivered to whichever process macOS attributes the click
// to, and on this path that was the second process, which never reaches
// notification-center initialization — so the session navigation of the
// normal click path (EventNotificationClicked → useNotificationClicks) is not
// recoverable here. Focus-only is the designed behavior; see ADR-075.
//
// Wails starts the second-instance processor goroutine in NewFrontend, before
// OnStartup binds a.wailsCtx() — a relay that arrives during this instance's own
// startup finds ctx nil. That is harmless rather than a bug to fix: startup
// is still mid-flight, the window is revealed by the startup phases anyway,
// and there is nothing to steal focus from yet.

// InstanceLock is the exclusively-held, process-lifetime OS lock guarding
// "the one c0wrk instance" for this user. It is an advisory cross-process
// gate only (enforcement is the Wails SingleInstanceLock relay above); its
// job in main.go is to let a second process know, BEFORE it touches any
// shared state, that it must stay read-only toward ~/.c0wrk — most
// importantly the crash-capture liveness marker, whose stash/overwrite by a
// transient relay process would poison the next start's unclean-shutdown
// forensics (crashlog.RemoveMarker is pid-aware and leaves foreign markers
// in place, so an orphaned relay marker survives as a false "did not shut
// down cleanly" warning). See ADR-075 and specs/domains/crash-logging.md.

//     release the lock under GC); main.go defers Close for exactly that.

//     is a second instance and must not mutate shared state (crash capture,
//     markers) before the Wails relay exits it.
//   - (nil, true, err): the lock could not be set up (unopenable path, IO
//     error). This FAILS OPEN to "first instance": a wedged lock file must
