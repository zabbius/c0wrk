	// ── Cross-goroutine lifecycle state ─────────────────────────────────
	//
	// ctx, FrontendAPI (above), app, logger, db, sessionLogger and
	// shutdownHardDeadline are written by the Wails OnStartup goroutine while
	// Startup runs. They are read concurrently by:
	//   - the second-instance relay goroutine (Wails starts it inside
	//     NewFrontend, before the OnStartup goroutine is even spawned — so a
	//     relay delivered during this instance's own startup reads these
	//     fields with no happens-before edge to the writes), and
	//   - the Wails binding-dispatch goroutines (App methods like
	//     PickDirectory / ConfirmExit / PersistWindowBounds run there, and
	//     each promoted FrontendAPI RPC re-reads the embedded pointer), and
	//   - the close/quit path (OnBeforeClose and Shutdown run on the platform
	//     main goroutine and can fire while a first-run Startup is still
	//     mid-flight, minutes from its last field write).
	//
	// stateMu provides the happens-before edge: every write goes through a
	// set* helper that takes it for writing, and every read outside the
	// OnStartup goroutine goes through the matching accessor (Context, log,
	// application, database, sessionLog, frontendAPI, shutdownDeadline),
	// which takes it for reading. The accessors are leaf helpers — they
	// never call each other and never run caller code under the lock, so
	// the critical sections are single field loads/stores and cannot
	// deadlock. Reads on the OnStartup goroutine itself (the Startup phases)
	// are ordered by program order and do not need the lock, but they use
	// the accessors anyway so no future caller has to know which goroutine
	// it is on.

//
//		Linux     WindowShow is gtk_widget_show — a bare map call that is a NO-OP
//		          for an already-mapped (but covered or minimized) window: no
//		          raise, no focus, no restore. WindowUnminimise is the real
//		          activation primitive there: gtk_window_present, which raises,
//		          deiconifies and focuses (EWMH _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW). So on Linux
//	         the present call ALONE is the full reveal+raise, and the plain
//	         Show is skipped (calling both just double-queues main-thread
//	         work for the same effect).
//
//		darwin    WindowShow is makeKeyAndOrderFront + activateIgnoringOtherApps
//		          — already the full activation; WindowUnminimise (deminiaturize)
//		          adds nothing the Show doesn't do, so it is skipped.
//
//		Windows   ShowWindow maps + activates, but WindowUnminimise maps to the
//		          WPF Form.Restore(), which UNMAXIMIZES a maximized window — so it
//		          runs only when the window is actually minimized. The restore
//		          path is the only way to bring the window back from the taskbar
//		          without a focus-steal fight with the shell.
