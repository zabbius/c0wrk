// Shared graph-application orchestrator for every research mutation /
// incremental-fetch site ([18]b). The file-watcher path always guarded its
// applies; the two direct mutation paths (the workspace editor's save and
// the dashboard's quick status flip) previously applied their responses
// unconditionally. Every site now funnels through one helper that owns the
// two guards the review found missing:
//
//   1. ([18]a) the active c0wrk project must STILL be the one the fetch or
//      RPC targeted when the response lands — a project switch mid-flight
//      drops the payload silently instead of painting the old project's
//      graph onto the new project's panel (R-NNN ids collide across
//      projects, so the stale graph would otherwise be accepted).
//   2. loadGraph() === false (a research project the store has never seen,
//      or a stale [60] LWW ticket) means the incremental apply is
//      impossible — converge via the full status refetch so the panel never
//      freezes on stale data.
//
// Pure module — no React — so it is unit-testable against the real stores
// (mirroring researchLogUtils / researchWorkspaceUtils).
