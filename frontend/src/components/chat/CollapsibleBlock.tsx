   * the component's tree position, so a remount or a reorder while the pointer

   * until the next `mouseover`. A stable item-derived id survives those.

       * Width contract for ellipsis in the header row.

       * CollapsibleTrigger renders a <button>. Unlike a block <div>, a <button>
       * shrink-to-fits to its content and does NOT stretch to fill its
       * container — so a long title (e.g. a bash_exec command) makes the button
       * grow to full content width, spilling past the chat edge and forcing a
       * horizontal scrollbar. With no width pressure on its flex children,
       * `min-w-0 truncate` does nothing and no overflow is ever detected.
       *
       * `max-w-full` caps the button at the chat column width (when content
       * exceeds it, the button = column width; when content is short, the button
       * stays content-width — no layout change for short titles). `min-w-0` lets
       * it shrink as a flex item. Together they force the flex children — the
       * label span carrying `min-w-0 truncate` — to actually ellipsize, which in
       * turn makes `scrollWidth > clientWidth` reliable for overflow-gated
       * tooltips.
       *
       * Because the button is now a width-constrained flex row, every icon-like
       * flex child MUST carry `shrink-0`: for SVGs `min-width:auto` resolves to 0
       * (SVG has overflow:hidden), so without `flex-shrink:0` the glyph shrinks
       * toward 0 as the title overflows. The chevron span, the tool `icon`, and
       * the `statusIcon` all carry it.
