/**
 * Collapsible wrapper around ONE work segment of a chat turn — the activity
 * (thoughts, tool cards, intermediate texts, …) that ran before the segment's
 * plan/subagent steps, as split by `splitTurnWork`. Step blocks render OUTSIDE
 * any collapsible (the plan-panel contract), between their segment's block
 * and the next one.
 *
 * Open-state rule: the LAST segment of a turn is OPEN while the turn is LIVE
 * (it is the last turn AND the session's task is still active — streaming,
 * plan steps, tool calls can still land) and auto-COLLAPSES when the turn
 * settles: the answer commits, OR the turn is superseded (a nudge / resume
 * started a new turn), OR the task ended without an answer (stop / error /
 * app exit — historical dead turns settle the same way after a reload).
 * EARLIER segments are settled from birth (`cutByStep`): the step that cut
 * them out completed the activity they hold, so they render COLLAPSED with
 * the completed status — "block considered finished when a step appeared".
 * A manual toggle wins until the next auto edge, mirroring SubAgentBlock:
 * `userOverride ?? derived`, with the override reset by a `useEffect` keyed
 * on the settle edge. The reverse edge — the turn stops being the last one —
 * remounts the block (the next turn's split takes over), which naturally
 * resets the override.
