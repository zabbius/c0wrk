// React seam for the tab activation engine (lib/tabEngine).
//
// The hook owns ONE engine instance for its mount lifetime:
//   - `useProjectSwitchState()` is a stable useCallback, so the engine (and
//     its activation chain) is created once per mount and rapid re-renders
//     share the same serialization queue;
//   - the write-back subscriptions are mounted in an effect (no module-level
//     side effects): from the first commit the active tab mirrors the live
//     workspace, under any uiStore.tabsEnabled value — with the flag off
//     that single tab IS the workspace mirror;
//   - `activate` never rejects (the engine rolls failures back internally),
//     so tab-bar click handlers can fire and forget safely.

/** What the UI needs from the tab layer: the single activation entry point. */
