/**
 * Reads the Model Profiles gate (the `model_profiles.enabled` master toggle and the
 * `essential_tools_enabled` sub-toggle) from the shared store and keeps it in sync
 * with the backend's resolved config. This gate is independent of the
 * experimental-features switch, which controls only the E2S execution mode.
 * Unlike `useExperimentalFeatures` — whose Settings
 * writes the store directly — this store has NO direct writer, so the backend
 * events are the only way a runtime config change reaches it.
 *
 * The fetch runs on mount and on two global events:
 *   - `backend:ready` — a RETRY-ONLY trigger. It re-attempts the mount fetch
 *     when that attempt failed or resolved with `loaded=false` (the backend
 *     answers RPCs with a zeroed config until Startup finishes — the same race
 *     App.tsx guards against). Once the gate has latched it is a no-op.
 *   - `config:updated` — a REFRESH trigger, emitted by the backend after every
 *     persisted config mutation (see specs/contracts/event-catalog.md). It
 *     IGNORES the latch and overwrites the store with the freshly resolved
 *     values, so a change the user just made in Settings — e.g. following the
 *     block hint to disable the profile or the Essential Tools variant — takes
 *     effect without an app restart. When the response still reports
 *     `loaded=false` (mid-startup) it leaves the store untouched rather than
 *     downgrading an existing good latch.
 *
 * Fail-safe: on a fetch error the store is left as it was — `loaded=false` on
 * the initial load, so consumers see "unknown" rather than "definitively off",
 * and a retry can still recover. The backend remains the authoritative
 * enforcement point for the gate.
 *
 * @returns whether goal mode is currently blocked by the ModelProfiles profile.
