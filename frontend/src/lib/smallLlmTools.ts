 * One selectable entry in the Small-LLM "Always-present tools" picker.
 *
 * The picker mixes two kinds of entry:
 *   - a **cluster** (see `SmallLLMToolGroup`): picking it pins every member at
 *     once (`members`), so a workflow can never be selected partially — e.g.
 *     the plan-step tool without the plan-declaration tool;
 *   - a **single tool** left ungrouped (`members` undefined).
 *
 * `tooltip` is compact **markdown** rendered by the picker: for a cluster it is
 * the cluster description followed by a bullet list of every member tool; for a
 * tool it is that tool's registry description, reformatted from its plain
 * rubric lines (`Purpose:` / `Use when:` / …) into bold-labelled paragraphs
 * (see `toolDescriptionMarkdown`).

 * allowed:
 *

 *   - implicitly — the protected orchestration tools (`protectedTools`, which
 *     the backend also unions into `alwaysPresent`) and every MCP tool, which
 *     is never a built-in and therefore never appears in `builtinTools`.
 *
 * Clusters come first, each offering only its still-selectable members (and
 * hidden entirely when none remain); their markdown tooltip lists ALL cluster
 * members, including already-allowed ones, so the entry documents the whole
 * workflow. Ungrouped tools follow in backend order (sorted). Grouped tools are
 * never listed individually — that is what makes the cluster atomic.
