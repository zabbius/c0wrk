/**
 * Experimental-features switch, loaded once from GetConfig and updated in place
 * when the user toggles it in Settings. Its only gated feature is the E2S
 * execution mode, which reads its availability reactively so hiding/revealing
 * happens within the same session without a reload. Model Profiles is a
 * first-class feature and is NOT gated by this switch.
 *
 * This switch is the SOLE availability gate for E2S — there is no
 * per-feature config toggle. E2S availability is exactly `enabled`, which is
 * DISTINCT from `inputModeStore.e2sEnabled`, the user's per-message ARMED
 * toggle: availability is a config fact, arming is a user preference, and a
 * fail-closed gate must combine BOTH. The composition lives in exactly one
 * place (`lib/e2sGate`) so no call site can substitute one flag for the other.
