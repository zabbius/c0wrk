// Global cross-project session snapshot for the sessions badge / switcher.
//
// Owns the DB-side state only:
//   - `sessions` — the listAllSessions() snapshot (null = never loaded),
//   - `pendingOverride` — authoritative "session X has pending HITL" bits
//     from GetPendingActions (for sessions whose messages chatStore never
//     loaded, the live HITL scan cannot see their blocked prompt).
//
// The LIVE side (taskActive / paused / HITL) is deliberately NOT stored here:
// chatStore is the single source of truth for live execution state (same
// rationale as useSessionStatusIndicator — no dual bookkeeping). Derive it at
// render time with the pure helpers in lib/activeSessions.
//
// Selector stability (React #185): every state field is either a primitive or
// a reference that only changes on real updates (`sessions` is replaced only
// after a successful RPC, `pendingOverride` only when a bit flips). Select
// fields directly — `useActiveSessionsStore(s => s.sessions)` — and do any
// aggregation in useMemo via lib/activeSessions, never inside a selector.

 *
 * Switch-time refresh: EVERY project/session switch (the CHAT↔CODE toggle

 * same chatStore flags the switch dance can corrupt (a cancelled
 * task-flag restore leaves a running session flagged idle), so it alone

 *
 * Safety poll: while the window is visible, refresh every
 * SNAPSHOT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS as a backstop against refresh-RPC failures and
 * stale-answer races (see the constant's doc). It rides the same 500ms
 * debounce funnel, so a poll colliding with an event-driven refresh coalesces
