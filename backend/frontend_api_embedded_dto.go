// The wire shapes of the embedded local model RPC surface and the mappers that
// build them (see specs/contracts/desktop-frontend.md and
// specs/domains/embedded-llm.md).
//
// Ownership: this file owns ONLY boundary data — every DTO that crosses the
// Wails binding, its request counterpart, and the pure functions that map a
// core or config value onto it. It owns no policy, no state and no I/O. The
// RPCs that return these shapes live in frontend_api_embedded.go, and the
// tuning patch fold that consumes the request shapes lives in
// frontend_api_embedded_tuning.go.
//
// The conventions the shapes follow:
//
//   - fields are ADDITIVE at this boundary: the hand-written frontend guards
//     check the presence and type of the fields THEY know, so a payload from a
//     newer backend still validates and a renderer that has not caught up
//     simply ignores what it does not read.
//   - a nullable knob stays nullable (a pointer), because "unset — the planner
//     decides" and "explicitly set to the planner's own answer" are different
//     operator statements and must not collapse into one.
//   - every array is an empty slice rather than nil, so there is no null to
//     distinguish from an empty one anywhere in the payload.

// EmbeddedLLMStatus is the payload of GetEmbeddedLLMStatus: the supervision
// state plus the install record the Settings page and the status bar render.
// Every field is always present (no omitempty) so the frontend never has to
// distinguish "absent" from "zero".
//
// Fields are ADDITIVE at this boundary and stay that way: the hand-written
// frontend guard (isEmbeddedLLMStatus in frontend/src/api/embedded.ts) checks
// the presence and type of the fields IT knows, so a payload from a newer
// backend still validates and a renderer that has not caught up simply ignores
// what it does not read. The two composite additions follow the same rule from
// the other side — Devices and Plan.Notes are always arrays and Plan is a value
// carrying its own Recorded flag — so there is no null to distinguish from an
// empty one anywhere in the payload.
