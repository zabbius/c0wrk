// The RPC surface of the embedded local model (see
// specs/domains/embedded-llm.md and specs/contracts/desktop-frontend.md).
//
// Ownership: this file owns the FrontendAPI-side wiring of
// core/embeddedllm — the supervisor, the installer, the config sink and the
// two global events. It owns NO policy: the command line, the resolution, the
// state machine and the idle budget all live in core. Two slices of the same
// surface live beside it: the wire shapes and their mappers in
// frontend_api_embedded_dto.go, and the operator tuning / device-probe RPCs in
// frontend_api_embedded_tuning.go.
//
// The conventions the surface follows:
//
//   - GetEmbeddedLLMStatus is a read-only getter and therefore returns no
//     error (desktop-frontend.md "RPC Surface"): an unavailable subsystem
//     reports the not-installed state instead of failing.
//   - every mutating method returns an error, and an error it returns is
//     actionable — it names the refused operation and the reason.
//   - the multi-gigabyte install runs in the BACKGROUND: InstallEmbeddedLLM
//     performs only the synchronous gates (single-run, hardware probe, the
//     combined memory refusal) and then returns, so the RPC never blocks on a
//     download. Progress arrives through embedded_llm:install_progress.
//   - download failures are split by resumability, and only the fatal half is
//     ever user-visible: a resumable transfer failure (a dropped connection,
//     an unreachable server, a retryable HTTP refusal) is retried SILENTLY
//     inside core/embeddedllm's Downloader — no toast, no error field, the
//     progress bar simply continues from the kept partial. A FATAL failure
//     (core's ErrAttemptsExhausted: no network after
//     embeddedllm.DefaultMaxFailedAttempts consecutive zero-progress attempts,
//     a checksum mismatch, the disk guard, …) is recorded as the
//     Settings-facing install_error (embeddedInstallFailureMessage translates
//     it) and raises the runtime_error toast with the same friendly text —
//     never the raw transport diagnostics. The status-bar indicator shows
//     NONE of them: its error surface is the supervisor's own error state.
//   - the background install is CANCELLABLE: CancelEmbeddedLLMInstall delivers
//     the operator's stop through the cancel published at gate-claim time, and
//     a REQUESTED cancellation (the flag AND the cancellation cause agreeing)
//     is the quiet outcome — no toast, no recorded error, the click is the
//     report — while core keeps the partial download as the resume point. A
//     genuine failure and a shutdown-cancellation stay reported failures.
//   - startup performs no network I/O and never loads the model
//     (initEmbeddedLLM); it only restores the state from manifest.json.

// Budgets of the synchronous parts of this surface. The install itself is
// unbounded (it is a multi-gigabyte resumable download on a background
// goroutine); these bound only what an RPC waits for.
const (
	// embeddedProbeTimeout bounds the hardware probe the install RPC runs
	// before it commits to a background download. Every external probe command
	// is already bounded inside core (2s each), so this is the outer belt: a
	// machine with every probe helper installed and wedged must still return
	// an actionable error instead of hanging the settings dialog.
	embeddedProbeTimeout = 30 * time.Second
	// embeddedStopTimeout bounds every supervisor stop this surface waits for:
	// the shutdown stop, UnloadEmbeddedLLM, the stop RemoveEmbeddedLLM runs
	// first, and the step-0 stop a background install performs before its first
	// numbered step. The install one travels to core as Installer.StopTimeout
	// rather than as a wrapped context, because the install runs on the
	// application context and its stop is the only call in that sequence nobody
	// else bounds. The supervisor's own graceful window is DefaultStopTimeout (10s)
	// followed by a kill and a bounded post-kill wait, so this only covers a
	// wedged terminate path — and, more importantly, the wait for the
	// single-instance gate an in-flight load holds for up to DefaultReadyTimeout
	// (minutes). Quitting must not hang on a model that refuses to die, a
	// blocking RPC must not hang its UI spinner for the length of a cold weight
	// load, and an install must not sit in step 0 for that same length while
	// holding the operation gate every other embedded call refuses behind —
	// step 0 precedes the plan, so it precedes the first install_progress event,
	// and the operator would be left watching a bar at 0%.
	//
	// This budget bounds the GATE WAIT, not the whole stop: when it expires with a
	// child still live, core's force path takes over, arms its own budget
	// (stopTimeout + killWait + 1s) on a detached context, terminates the child and
	// returns SUCCESS. So a stop-shaped call's real ceiling is this plus that force
	// budget, and the TRANSLATED "a load is still in progress" error — the one
	// embeddedBoundedStopErr produces, and it fires only on
	// errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded) — comes back only when no child had
	// spawned yet, the one case where there is nothing to kill and the gate timeout
	// is the whole truth. All four bounded paths can produce it, each on its own
	// channel: the shutdown stop logs it, UnloadEmbeddedLLM and RemoveEmbeddedLLM
	// return it to their caller, and an install carries it into its
	// background-failure toast.
	//
	// That scoping is deliberate: it is a claim about THIS translation, not about
	// every error a stop-shaped call can return. Two other paths produce actionable
	// errors with a child very much involved or none at all — a stop that did NOT
	// take is reported by core's terminate on BOTH the gated and the force path
	// ("did not exit within … of being killed", precisely the uninterruptible-
	// syscall case defaultKillWait exists for), and RemoveEmbeddedLLM's post-stop
	// work returns errors.Join over the three tree deletions plus Sink.ApplyRemoved,
	// so a read-only or busy tree yields an actionable error and no child was ever
	// part of it.

//   - infoMu guards the cached manifest snapshot, the restore-in-progress flag
//     and the last background failure. It is likewise never held across a
//     supervisor call.
//
// Neither mutex is ever taken while configMu is held, which keeps the lock

// behalf of the request the ensure-loaded transport is waiting on, which holds
// the supervisor's single-instance gate and the saveMu the rebuild needs), and
// a skipped rebuild is NOT acceptable either — the previous window is the
// install-time DefaultFitMinContext ESTIMATE, which under-represents the
// server and makes the router's pre-call guard refuse every prompt above
// roughly (window − output_reserve) × 95% until an unrelated rebuild.
//
// Single-flight: loads are serialized by the supervisor's gate, but the
// scheduled refresh runs AFTER the persist released its locks, so a fast
// second load can schedule while the first refresh is still running. That
// second schedule sets the dirty flag instead; the running loop reruns the
// refresh once more before closing, so no correction is ever lost — each run
// snapshots the CURRENT config, and the change itself is already durable.
