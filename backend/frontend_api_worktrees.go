// frontend_api_worktrees.go — the session-lifecycle side of ADR-080 managed
// worktrees. The worktrees.Owner coordinator (step: safe primitives) is
// deliberately stateless; this file is the "Git lifecycle owner" that drives
// it from the session RPC flows:
//
//   - CreateManagedSession: reserve identity (SessionDraft) → provision the
//     tree → commit the runtime session → persist the binding, compensating
//     (releasing the fresh tree) when the runtime or DB step fails. An
//     adopted (shared) tree commits its binding and re-validates the tree
//     inside the adoption↔deletion critical section (managedTreeMu), rolling
//     the just-committed session back when the last owner's deletion removed
//     the tree in between.
//   - ensureManagedWorkspace (installed as the manager's WorkspaceEnsurer):
//     lazy restore validates the stored Git identity and recreates a missing
//     tree from the pinned branch, surfacing the data-loss warning; it never
//     falls back to the project checkout.
//   - ForkSession (managed source): a new tree on <branch>-fork-<short-id>
//     created at the source's COMMITTED HEAD — uncommitted changes are
//     explicitly not carried into the fork.
//   - DeleteSession/DeleteSessionWithOptions: join the running task, stop the
//     session terminal, then recheck dirtiness at removal time; a dirty (or
//     locked) tree blocks deletion with a typed decision error so the session
//     stays retryable until the user confirms the loss. The [count remaining
//     co-owners → release] pair runs under the same critical section as the
//     adoption commit, so a shared tree is only ever released for a last
//     owner whose count saw every committed binding.
