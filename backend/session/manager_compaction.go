// CompactSessionContext starts a MANUAL context compaction for the session:
// the session's cross-task conversation history (what the orchestrator injects
// as prior conversation into every request) is compacted with the named
// strategy. The UI chat history is untouched — only the LLM-visible context
// shrinks.
//
// Flow (asynchronous — returns immediately after validation):
//  1. compaction_started is emitted and the session is flagged compacting
//     (sends/resumes now fail with ErrSessionCompacting).
//  2. If a task is running, the flow pauses it exactly like PauseSession
//     (cooperative pause at the next step boundary) and waits for the request
//     goroutine to exit — the same wait semantics as a user-initiated pause.
//  3. The orchestrator's history is compacted (orchestrator.
//     CompactConversationHistory). LLM-backed strategies run their summarize
//     calls through the session's tracking caller, so tokens are counted.
//     A no-op compaction (ErrNothingCompacted — the dialogue already fits
//     within the strategy's limits) is NOT a failure: the flow finishes
//     successfully with nothing_compacted=true and no marker row.
//     3.5. When nothing was compacted but a paused unfinished task is about to
//     be auto-resumed, the compaction is deferred to the resume instead:
//     the orchestrator's one-shot resume-compaction request is armed
//     (RequestResumeCompaction) BEFORE the auto-resume below, so the resumed
//     Conductor run force-compacts the merged trajectory up front — the real
//     numbers then arrive as the executor's context_compaction card.
//  4. On success a marker row (role context_compaction) is persisted with the
//     compacted history snapshot, so a restart restores the compacted history.
//     Skipped for the no-op outcome (phase 3): there is no compacted history
//     to snapshot.
//  5. If THIS flow paused the session, a paused checkpoint remains, AND the
//     pause is still owned by this flow (a user pause is never stolen: one
//     that races or follows the flow's own pause overwrites the owner, and
//     one already in flight when the flow armed keeps the user as owner —
//     either way the user's pause survives), the task is auto-resumed.
//     compaction_finished is emitted with the outcome (success / cancelled /
//     error + whether the session was resumed, nothing was compacted, or the
//     compaction was deferred to the resume).
//
// Cancellation (CancelSessionCompaction) during the pause-wait still waits for
// the checkpoint to land (unflipping the pause signal mid-flight would race
// the executor's step-boundary check) and then skips the compaction and
// auto-resumes; during the compaction itself it aborts the summarize calls,
// leaving the history untouched.
