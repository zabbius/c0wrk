# Session Worktrees

## Purpose

Defines how a CODE session is bound to an execution workspace — the project
checkout (`local`) or a managed git worktree (`managed_worktree`, shared by
several sessions since ADR-082) — and
how that binding stays separate from project identity and the Git panel's
focus. Covers persistence, validation, migration, restore, and fork identity,
plus the worktree provisioning primitives (`core/workspace/worktrees.go`),
the backend ownership coordinator (`backend/worktrees`), the
session-lifecycle wiring that drives them from the session RPC flows
(`backend/frontend_api_worktrees.go`: creation, restore, fork, deletion,
archive), and the Git-panel focus model that consumes the separation
(`backend/frontend_api_git_focus.go`: focus-target resolution behind every
git RPC, the worktree listing RPC, and the pinned-branch refusal).

## Key Files

- `core/workspace/worktrees.go` — the safe git-worktree primitive service: `ListWorktrees` (strict porcelain parsing, main/managed/external classification), `AddWorktree`/`RecreateWorktree`/`RemoveWorktree`/`PruneWorktrees` with per-repo serialization, branch-occupancy validation, structural path validation and the explicit failure taxonomy; installs the `/.worktrees/` exclusion into the common dir's `info/exclude`
- `backend/worktrees/owner.go` — `Owner`: the backend ownership coordinator (Provision/Recreate/Release/List/Inspect); every path derived via `config.ManagedWorktreePath`, managed-only mutation, release never deletes branches
- `backend/frontend_api_worktrees.go` — the Git lifecycle owner driving the coordinator from the session flows: `CreateManagedSession` (draft → provision → `CreateSessionFromDraft` → persist, compensated on runtime/DB failure), the `WorkspaceEnsurer` installed on the session manager (restore validation + recreation warning), `forkManagedSession` (new tree at source committed HEAD), and the deletion protocol (`DeleteSessionWithOptions`, `SessionDeleteBlockedError`)
- `core/pathsegments.go` — `WorktreesRelativePath` (the shared `.worktrees` segment constant)
- `backend/session/workspace_binding.go` — `WorkspaceKind`, `WorkspaceBinding`, `WorkspaceEnsurer`, `NormalizeWorkspaceBinding`, `SessionDraft`/`NewSessionDraft`, context DTOs (`ProjectContext`, `GitPanelTarget`, `SessionContexts`)
- `backend/session/workspace_context.go` — `ResolveSessionContexts` (execution workspace vs Git-panel target)
- `backend/session/persistence_binding.go` — `sessions.workspace_binding` migration, the shared-tree index migration (UNIQUE → plain `idx_session_managed_workspace`) and `CountManagedWorktreeSessions` (the release refcount), binding encode/decode, shared binding columns for list/load queries
- `backend/session/persistence.go` — binding-aware `SaveSession`/`LoadSession`/`ListSessions*`; immutable-identity upsert
- `backend/session/persistence_fork.go` — `ForkSessionWithBinding` (managed fork requires a new tree + derived branch)
- `backend/session/manager.go` — `CreateSessionFromDraft` (commit a prepared workspace), `SetWorkspaceEnsurer` + the restore-time ensure inside `getOrRestoreSession`'s single-flight, `HasSession` (non-restoring existence), binding-aware lazy restore and `WorkspacePathFor`
- `backend/config/paths.go` — `ManagedWorktreesDir`, `ManagedWorktreePath` (the only place `.worktrees` paths are constructed or validated)
- `backend/frontend_api_git_focus.go` — the Git-panel focus model: `SetGitPanelFocus`/`GetGitPanelFocus`/`ListProjectWorktrees` RPCs, `resolveGitFocusRoot` (the focus resolution behind `resolveGitRepoRoot`), owning-session metadata, the pinned-branch guard (`ErrPinnedWorktreeBranch`, `refusePinnedBranchSwitch`), and the fail-soft vector-registry re-point every accepted focus move carries (`focusVectorRoots` → `ApplyFocus`)
- `backend/frontend_api_vector.go` — vector-index RPC surface (`SearchVectorStore`/`GetVectorIndexStatus`/`ReindexVectorIndex`, all routed to the Git-panel FOCUS root), focus-target resolution (`resolveVectorIndexTarget` — the project switch resolves the saved session's tree), worktree-scoped storage (`config.WorktreeVectorIndexPath`), release cleanup (`deleteWorktreeVectorIndex`: registry release → storage → per-tree cache) and provisioning seeding (`seedWorktreeEmbeddingCache`: copies the checkout's embedding cache into a fresh tree's cache root)
- `backend/vector_roots.go` — the per-root registry (ADR-081): one `vectorindex.Manager` per workspace root (single-flight creation, LRU-bounded live set with the focus pinned), agent-side routing by the executor context's workspace root, `ApplyFocus`/`LeaveFocus`, `Release`/`ReleaseProject`/`ShutdownAll`, and `Application.buildVectorRouter` (the shared search closures)
- `core/vectorindex/git.go` — `resolveGitDir` follows a linked worktree's `.git` pointer file to the private git directory that owns HEAD, so the vector index's branch monitoring works inside managed trees; `backend/config/paths.go` `ManagedWorktreeNameFromPath`/`WorktreeVectorIndexPath` derive the per-tree index storage
- `frontend/src/lib/gitFocus.ts` + `frontend/src/hooks/useGitFocusSync.ts` — the frontend side: serialized/supersede-guarded focus applies and the follow-the-session effect (project/session switches move the focus to the active session's execution workspace); the hook is mounted once at the App root (beside `useVectorIndexStatus`) — the Git panel lives only while the git tab is active, and the follow must also run on chat-area session switches with any other tab open
- `frontend/src/stores/sessionDraftStore.ts` + `frontend/src/lib/sessionDraft.ts` — the chat-side draft UX: the pending New-Session draft (project + drafted workspace) and `createSessionFromDraft()`, the single commit path that routes a branch draft to `CreateManagedSession` and everything else to `CreateSession`
- `frontend/src/components/chat/SessionWorkspaceSelector.tsx` + `frontend/src/components/GitPanel/BranchPicker.tsx` — the draft's selection surfaces: the chat toolbar selector (`local` / `branch…`, read-only pinned display for existing sessions) and the BranchPicker's intent-separated draft mode (`branchPickerMode: 'draft'`) that records a picked/created branch without any checkout

## Core Types

```go
type WorkspaceKind string // "local" | "managed_worktree"

type WorkspaceBinding struct {
    Kind          WorkspaceKind
    WorkspacePath string // derived at validation; stored copy is advisory
    WorktreeName  string // managed only; single portable path component
    Branch        string // managed only; pinned at selection, not live HEAD
}

type SessionDraft struct {          // identity reserved before provisioning
    ID              string
    ProjectID       string
    WorkspaceBinding *WorkspaceBinding // nil for CHAT and local
}
```

`SessionInfo.WorkspaceBinding *WorkspaceBinding` (nil ⇒ CHAT) is returned by
the frontend API as-is; `Session.WorkspaceBinding()` returns a defensive copy.

## Flow

### Creation (managed)

The chat-side draft UX feeds this RPC: New Session arms a draft
(`sessionDraftStore`); the chat toolbar's workspace selector and the
BranchPicker's draft mode record the choice (`local` or a branch — selection
never checks out); the first send / attachment / paste /
terminal open commits it via `lib/sessionDraft.createSessionFromDraft()`,
which calls `CreateManagedSession` for a branch draft and `CreateSession`
otherwise.

```
UI → RPC CreateManagedSession(branch, createBranch, startPoint)
  → NewSessionDraft(projectID, nil)                 // identity reserved, nothing created
  → binding validated (NormalizeWorkspaceBinding)   // BEFORE any git runs
  → branch-holder lookup (createBranch=false only)  // git allows one worktree per branch
      managed tree holds it  → ADOPT: binding re-pinned to the holder's tree
                               name; Owner.Recreate re-validates (no-op /
                               prune+recreate / explicit mismatch failure);
                               no compensation — the tree is not ours
      main checkout holds it → silent LOCAL fallback (Manager.CreateSession in
                               the checkout; best-effort persistence)
      external tree holds it → typed ErrBranchBusy refusal naming the tree
      no holder              → provision below
  → worktrees.Owner.ProvisionNewBranch / ProvisionBranch
                                                    // serialized git worktree add at
                                                    // <repo>/.worktrees/s-<short id>; branch
                                                    // occupancy validated; /.worktrees/
                                                    // exclusion installed in info/exclude
  → Manager.CreateSessionFromDraft(draft, repoRoot) // validates, then builds orchestrator
  → store.SaveSession(info)                         // persisted binding REQUIRED
```

Sharing (ADR-082): a branch held by an existing managed tree is REUSED — the
new session binds to that tree and several sessions execute in it, exactly
like local sessions sharing the checkout. Orphaned trees (crash between
provisioning and commit, a lost session row) are adopted the same way, and a
prunable orphan is repaired on adoption. The adoption commit re-validates the
tree after the binding is persisted, inside the same critical section
(`FrontendAPI.managedTreeMu`) as the release's [count → remove] pair below:
when the last owner's deletion removed the tree in between, the
just-committed session is rolled back (row and in-memory session removed; the
branch is kept) and the creation fails with an explicit retryable error — a
session can never survive bound to a tree that no longer exists (an in-memory
session would get no restore ensurer until restart). Compensation: if the
runtime commit or the persistence step fails after provisioning a FRESH tree,
the in-memory session is removed and the fresh tree released (best-effort,
logged); adopted trees are never touched; the created branch is KEPT — no
operation in this path ever deletes a branch. `CreateSession(projectID,
workspacePath)` remains the local/CHAT entry point and wraps the same path
with a nil binding.

#### Embedding-cache seeding

After its success point (create: after the binding is persisted; fork: after
the store fork), both provisioning flows call `seedWorktreeEmbeddingCache`
(backend `frontend_api_vector.go`): the project checkout's content-addressed
embedding cache is copied into the fresh tree's cache root
(`config.WorktreeEmbeddingCachePath`) — synchronously, before the RPC returns,
so the frontend's immediate focus move builds the tree's vector manager over
an already-warm cache. A session tree is 99-100% identical to its branch
point, and the cache — keyed by chunk-text hash plus model fingerprint with
paths deliberately excluded — is the one layer where that identity is legally
reusable (branch collections are absolute-path-keyed and cannot be shared);
with a warm seed the tree's first index pass reuses the checkout's embeddings
instead of re-running ONNX inference over near-identical content. The seed is
best-effort and idempotent: a missing checkout cache, a derivation failure, or
a partial copy only means the first pass runs cold (copied entries are
checksum-guarded, so a torn file is a miss, never a wrong vector); an existing
target directory is never touched; per-file failures against the checkout's
live cache are skipped. The recreate path needs no call — its cache root
survives the lost tree.

### Restore

Lazy restore and `WorkspacePathFor` decode the stored binding and normalize it
against the project's *current* root: `local` follows the checkout wherever it
is registered; `managed_worktree` re-derives
`<repoRoot>/.worktrees/<name>`. For managed bindings `getOrRestoreSession`
runs the installed `WorkspaceEnsurer` (backend `ensureManagedWorkspace`)
inside the restore single-flight, before the orchestrator is built:
`worktrees.Owner.Recreate` guarantees the tree exists on the pinned branch —
no-op when present and matching, mismatch refused (never silently
retargeted), stale metadata pruned and the tree re-created from the existing
branch, and a missing branch is an explicit failure (restore never creates
branches). When the tree had to be recreated, the manager emits a
`service` event (`phase: "orchestration"` — the chat-visibility
discriminator, so the warning renders as a chat row and persists across
reloads) stating that uncommitted changes that existed only in the missing
tree could not be recovered. Identity lookup
never invents a path, and a managed restore never falls back to the project
checkout (no ensurer configured ⇒ fail closed). Once restored, the session's
search tools route through the executor context to its own tree's manager —
created on demand by the per-root registry
([Vector Index routing](workspace.md#vector-index), [ADR-081](../decisions/081-vector-per-root-registry.md)) — so a
missing tree is materialized by the restore ensurer before the first search
ever targets it.

### Release (deletion)

`FrontendAPI.DeleteSession`/`DeleteSessionWithOptions` release the managed
tree BEFORE any session runtime state is removed (the one exception is the
deleting session's own store row on the shared path — step 3), in this order:

1. join the running task (`CancelTask` cancels and waits — the task's final
   writes are then visible to the dirty recheck);
2. stop the session terminal (its shell's cwd lives inside the tree);
3. count the tree's remaining owners
   (`CountManagedWorktreeSessions`, excluding the deleting session) and
   remove the deleting session's OWN row when others remain: while any other
   row — live or archived — still binds the tree, the release is SKIPPED
   (the tree and its uncommitted work stay for the remaining sessions, so
   the confirmations below are never reached) and the deleting session's row
   is removed right there — a concurrent co-owner deletion must observe it
   gone, or two simultaneous deletions of the last two owners would both
   skip and orphan the tree (the pre-flight then returns the project ID so
   the caller's store-only fallback can still clean the session's internal
   files); a count failure blocks the deletion (retryable) instead of
   risking a shared tree;
4. `worktrees.Owner.Release` (last owner only) — the primitives recheck
   dirtiness and lock state at removal time, so the confirmation is never
   based on a stale snapshot. A dirty tree requires
   `SessionDeleteOptions.ConfirmUncommittedLoss` and a locked tree
   `UnlockLockedTree`; otherwise the call fails with
   `*SessionDeleteBlockedError` (naming the deciding option) and the session,
   tree, and branch stay fully intact and retryable (the own-row removal of
   step 3 only happens on the shared path, where no blocking decision
   exists).

Steps 3 and 4 run together inside the adoption↔deletion critical section
(`FrontendAPI.managedTreeMu`) shared with the adoption commit's
[persist → re-validate] pair and with every other deletion's protocol, so
the count always sees every committed binding: a concurrent adoption either
commits (and is counted — release skipped) or commits after the removal and
rolls itself back (see Creation), and of two simultaneous co-owner
deletions the second always observes the first's row gone and releases.

A tree that is no longer linked is already gone (nothing to do); a tree
classified non-managed (main/external/foreign) is NEVER removed. Deletion
never resurrects: `Manager.DeleteSession` operates only on in-memory sessions
(the RPC gates on `Manager.HasSession`), so no restore can re-provision a
tree the pre-flight just released; store-only sessions release their tree via
the same pre-flight and finish through the store-only fallback. The branch is
never deleted (primitive-level invariant). Archiving a session retains its
tree and branch untouched.

### Fork

`ForkSession` (local source) keeps the local binding. A managed source goes
through `forkManagedSession` with a fresh tree name and the derived branch
`<source branch>-fork-<short dst id>` created at the source tree's COMMITTED
HEAD via `worktrees.Owner.ProvisionNewBranch`; reusing the source tree or
branch is rejected before any row is copied (`ForkSessionWithBinding`
enforces the distinct tree + branch). Uncommitted changes in the source are
NOT copied — the fork's starting point is the commit, and the source tree is
left untouched. A store-fork failure releases the freshly provisioned tree
(its branch is kept). The unfinished-task guard applies to both paths
unchanged.

### Git-panel focus model

Every git RPC resolves its repository root through the focus target
(`resolveGitRepoRoot` → `resolveGitFocusRoot`): the explicitly focused
worktree of the active project when one is set, the project checkout
otherwise. A vanished focus tree falls back to the checkout fail-soft and
clears the override (a stale focus never bricks every git RPC).

```
frontend (useGitFocusSync, mounted at the App root)  backend
  project/session switch ──► GetSessionWorkspace(sessionID)
                            └► SetGitPanelFocus(session workspace)   // default target
  worktree switcher ────────► SetGitPanelFocus(tree path)            // explicit
  focus button ─────────────► SetGitPanelFocus(session workspace)     // snap back
  any git RPC ◄──────────── resolveGitRepoRoot() = resolveGitFocusRoot()
  vector RPCs/status ◄───── vectorRootsRegistry().ApplyFocus(root)    // rides every accepted
                                                                      // move (fail-soft)
```

- `SetGitPanelFocus("")` resets to the default; a non-empty path is validated
  against the live `git worktree list` of the active project (checkout,
  managed tree, or external linked tree — foreign paths fail with
  `ErrWorktreeNotLinked`) and stores the canonical entry path.
- Every accepted focus move also re-points the per-root vector registry
  (`focusVectorRoots` → `ApplyFocus`): a non-empty focus lands on the
  canonical tree path, and the empty reset lands on the project checkout —
  deliberately NOT `LeaveFocus` (the visible index identity follows the
  checkout instead of going blank). Fail-soft, mirroring the project-switch
  vector setup: a root the registry cannot focus (manager factory still
  unwired in the startup race, unresolvable root) logs Warn and never fails
  the git RPC. `GetVectorIndexStatus`/`SearchVectorStore`/
  `ReindexVectorIndex` and the `vector_index:status` stream carry only the
  focused root, so after a session starts its tree's indexing progress is
  what the status bar reflects.
- `GetGitPanelFocus` reports the resolved target with its classification
  (`kind`: main/managed/external) and owning session; `ListProjectWorktrees`
  returns the full decorated list (`managed`/`pinned`, session id/name,
  `is_focus`) via `worktrees.Owner.List`.
- The pinned-branch decision: `CheckoutBranch`, `CreateBranch`,
  `CheckoutRemoteBranch`, and renaming the pinned branch are refused with
  `ErrPinnedWorktreeBranch` while the focus is a managed session worktree
  (classification via the `.worktrees` container containment — no git spawn);
  checking out the pin itself stays allowed, and the local checkout and
  external trees keep normal checkout. Switching a managed tree off its pin
  would desynchronize the immutable binding and break restore/recreate.
- Focus is UI state on the backend because the RPCs resolve it server-side;
  it never retargets execution (ADR-080's `GitPanelTarget` separation).
  `GetGitStatus` follows the focus root the same way (containment accepts
  the project workspace and, for an external-tree focus, the focus root).
  The vector-registry focus an accepted move drags along is likewise
  user-side only — agent-side routing stays context-borne (ADR-081), so
  focusing a tree never redirects another session's searches.

## Invariants

- A binding is immutable after creation: project, kind, worktree name, and
  branch never change for an existing session row (enforced by the upsert's
  `WHERE` identity comparison).
- A managed tree may be bound by SEVERAL sessions (ADR-082 shared trees);
  `idx_session_managed_workspace` is a plain lookup index, and the tree is
  released only when its last bound row is deleted
  (`CountManagedWorktreeSessions`) — and exactly then: the deletion protocol
  [count co-owners → own-row removal → release] runs inside the shared
  critical section, so simultaneous deletions of the last two owners release
  exactly once instead of both skipping and orphaning the tree. The count is
  archived rows included, and NOT scoped by project: tree names are
  UUID-derived and globally unique, so a repository registered as several
  projects binds the same tree across those project rows, and every binding
  must hold it open.
- A committed binding always names a tree that existed at commit time: the
  adoption's [persist binding → re-validate tree] and the release's
  [count co-owners → remove tree] pairs share one critical section
  (`FrontendAPI.managedTreeMu`), so a concurrent last-owner deletion either
  sees the committed binding (release skipped) or removes the tree first and
  the adoption rolls its just-committed session back — no row, no in-memory
  session; a retry then provisions a fresh tree for the surviving branch.
- Execution paths are derived, never trusted from storage: `local` ⇒ project
  root, `managed_worktree` ⇒ `ManagedWorktreePath(repoRoot, name)`; a stored
  `workspace_path` that disagrees is rewritten to the derived value.
- CHAT (`__no_project__`) sessions have no binding; a non-nil binding for them
  is invalid.
- `GitPanelTarget` may name only the owning project's checkout or one of its
  managed trees; it can never change `ExecutionWorkspace`.
- Git-panel focus resolution always funnels through `resolveGitFocusRoot`;
  a focus override is admitted only after worktree-list validation and falls
  back to the project checkout when the tree is gone.
- A `SetGitPanelFocus` move re-points the per-root vector registry focus
  (the empty reset targets the checkout, not `LeaveFocus`) and is fail-soft:
  a vector-side focus failure is logged at Warn and never fails the git RPC;
  the `vector_index:status` stream and the vector RPCs follow the panel.
- Branch-switching RPCs (`CheckoutBranch`, `CreateBranch`,
  `CheckoutRemoteBranch`, rename of the pinned branch) fail with
  `ErrPinnedWorktreeBranch` while the Git panel is focused on a managed
  session worktree and the resulting branch differs from the pin; the local
  checkout and external linked trees always keep normal checkout.
- `.worktrees` paths are constructed exclusively via `backend/config`
  helpers; the name is validated (portable, no traversal, no device names) and
  the container/tree must not be a symlink and must be inside the repo.
- Worktree mutations flow only through `core/workspace` primitives (hardened
  spawns, serialized per repo, explicit failure taxonomy) and the backend
  `worktrees.Owner`; mutating worktree operations never run arbitrary
  user/agent commands.
- The managed container is hidden via the common dir's `info/exclude`
  (`/.worktrees/`, idempotent, atomic); `.gitignore` is never modified.
- No operation in the provisioning path deletes a branch; session deletion
  removes the tree and its metadata only.
- Deletion never resurrects: `Manager.DeleteSession` refuses sessions not
  live in memory (the RPC gates on `HasSession`), so a deletion flow can
  never re-provision a tree it just released through the restore ensurer.
- Vector-index routing is per workspace root (ADR-081): every routed root
  owns a `vectorindex.Manager` with worktree-scoped storage under
  `<project vector_index>/worktrees/<name>` (branch resolved from that root;
  disjoint, simultaneously live state per tree). Agent-side search resolves
  the root from the executor context — a session always searches its own
  tree, regardless of which session is active or focused — while the
  user-facing RPCs follow the Git-panel focus. Membership is decided by
  containment in the project's `.worktrees` container, never by comparing
  paths to the checkout, and an unknown root is rejected rather than
  silently indexed. No send ever re-points shared index state.
- Releasing a managed tree releases its registry manager first (open chromem
  handles dropped so removal is Windows-safe), then removes its vector-index
  storage root and per-tree embedding cache; project deletion removes every
  worktree root together with the project root.
- Worktree embedding-cache seeding is a provisioning-time, best-effort,
  once-per-tree step: it runs only after the flow's success point and before
  the RPC returns, never touches an existing cache root, copies only the
  content-addressed entries (never branch collections — those are
  absolute-path-keyed and tree-specific), and its failure never fails the
  provisioning flow.

## Configuration

No `config.yaml` keys. The managed container is always
`<repo>/.worktrees/`, excluded from the main checkout's status via the common
`info/exclude` (installed by the primitives). CHAT workspaces remain
`~/.c0wrk/projects/__no_project__/<id>/workspace`.

## Extension Points

- Frontend UI for the managed lifecycle: the draft-time branch selection is landed — the chat toolbar's workspace selector (`SessionWorkspaceSelector`) offers `local` and `branch…`, and the BranchPicker's draft mode records a picked existing branch or a drafted new branch (+ start point) into `sessionDraftStore`; provisioning runs at draft commit via `CreateManagedSession` with no in-place checkout. Remaining consumer work: the `*SessionDeleteBlockedError` confirmation dialog → `DeleteSessionWithOptions` with the named option, and rendering of the `service` (`phase: "orchestration"`) recreation warning (the chat row rendering itself is live; a dedicated visual treatment may follow). The RPC protocol is complete.
- Git panel: the focus model is landed — `SetGitPanelFocus`/
  `GetGitPanelFocus`/`ListProjectWorktrees` with the worktree switcher
  (BranchPicker + BranchDropdown), the header focus button, and the
  follow-the-session sync (`useGitFocusSync`, mounted at the App root).
  Extensions keep the same
  contract: the focus target stays UI state resolved server-side and is
  never written back into the session binding; `Owner.List`/`Inspect` back
  the worktree views.
- Project deletion: `DeleteProject` currently removes in-memory sessions and
  the project directory; releasing the managed trees of the project's
  store-only sessions (same confirmation protocol as session deletion) is a
  follow-up consumer of the same `Owner.Release` seam.
- Additional kinds (if ever needed) extend `WorkspaceKind` and
  `NormalizeWorkspaceBinding` only — storage, restore, and fork identity flow
  through the same validation.
