# Row Action Overlay (`ItemAction` / `ItemActions`)

## Role

Shared hover-overlay primitives for list-row actions: `ItemAction` is one icon button, `ItemActions` is the absolutely-positioned gradient panel that slides over the right edge of a row and reveals its buttons on hover/focus. One implementation keeps every list surface visually and behaviorally in sync.

## Key Files

- `frontend/src/components/layout/ItemAction.tsx` — both primitives; no other file defines row-action buttons
- `frontend/src/components/layout/ProjectSelector.tsx` — project dropdown rows (Rename, Delete)
- `frontend/src/components/layout/SessionListItem.tsx` — session rows for both surfaces: `SessionSelector` (dropdown, CODE mode) and `SessionList` (flat, CHAT mode); the `variant` prop selects the outer element (`dropdown` → `DropdownMenuItem`, `flat` → `div[role=button]`); actions: Promote to project (only when the row's `project_id` is `__no_project__` AND the caller wired `onPromote` — CODE-mode selectors pass no callback, busy-gated with a promote-specific `disabledReason`), Pin/Unpin, Fork (busy-gated), Rename, Archive/Unarchive, Delete
- `frontend/src/components/GitPanel/LocalBranchRow.tsx` — local branch rows (Push, Merge, Rebase, Rename, Delete)
- `frontend/src/components/GitPanel/RemoteBranchRow.tsx` — remote branch rows (Delete on remote)
- `frontend/src/components/settings/ThemeMenuItem.tsx` — theme menu rows (Delete theme; predefined themes render no actions)
- `frontend/src/components/chat/BookmarksPanel.tsx` — bookmark rows (Rename, Delete)
- `frontend/src/components/research/ResearchProjectPicker.tsx` — research-project rows (Pin/Unpin, Delete)
- `frontend/src/components/research/ResearchHypothesisPicker.tsx` — hypothesis menu rows (Pin/Unpin)
- `frontend/src/components/layout/ItemAction.test.tsx` — pins the button feedback classes, the click/disabled behavior, and the title contract

## Behavior

### Tooltip contract

The **native `title` attribute is the only tooltip mechanism** for row-action buttons — no Radix Tooltip, no portal, no animation, no `TooltipProvider` requirement (tests render `ItemAction` bare). An enabled button carries `title = label`; the label text comes from the calling site (`label` prop).

A disabled button (`pointer-events-none`) never receives pointer events, so its own `title` would never show. The `disabledReason` is therefore mirrored as the `title` of the focusable wrapper `span` (keyboard users focus the span via its `tabIndex=0`; hovering the span shows the reason). The reason is also mirrored onto the button's own `title` for assistive tech. Because the wrapper span is the tab stop while disabled and its disabled button contents are excluded from accessible-name computation, the span also carries `aria-label = "label: reason"` — the action keeps an accessible name exactly while it is disabled. `disabled` without `disabledReason` leaves the wrapper's title and aria-label unset and the button's `title` at `label`.

### Consumers

| Surface | File | Actions |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| Project selector rows | `ProjectSelector.tsx` | Rename, Delete |
| Session rows (dropdown + flat) | `SessionListItem.tsx` | Promote to project (No Project rows only, busy-gated), Pin/Unpin, Fork (busy-gated), Rename, Archive/Unarchive, Delete |
| Local branch rows | `LocalBranchRow.tsx` | Push, Merge, Rebase, Rename, Delete |
| Remote branch rows | `RemoteBranchRow.tsx` | Delete on remote |
| Theme menu rows | `ThemeMenuItem.tsx` | Delete theme |
| Bookmark rows | `BookmarksPanel.tsx` | Rename, Delete |
| Research-project rows | `ResearchProjectPicker.tsx` | Pin/Unpin, Delete |
| Hypothesis menu rows | `ResearchHypothesisPicker.tsx` | Pin/Unpin |

### Hover overlay mechanics

`ItemActions` is `absolute inset-y-0 right-0` with a leftward `from-popover` gradient so the underlying relative-time text stays readable; `opacity-0` → `group-hover/item:opacity-100` / `group-focus-within/item:opacity-100`; the parent row must be `relative` and carry the `group/item` class. Pointer events are contained (`stopPropagation` on pointerdown/pointerup/click) so clicking an action never selects the row — this stopPropagation is load-bearing for Radix menu rows (deleting a theme or a branch must not also select the row).

## Invariants

- Every row-action button in the app renders through `ItemAction`; no surface builds its own hover-overlay action button.
- The tooltip is always the native `title` — Radix Tooltip must not be re-introduced here; app-root `TooltipProvider` is not required to render these components.
- A disabled action's `disabledReason` is reachable without pointer events: it sits on the focusable wrapper span's `title` (and on the button's own `title`), and the wrapper span's `aria-label` keeps the action named (`"label: reason"`) for assistive tech.
- `ItemAction` buttons keep their own hover/active feedback (`transition-colors`, `enabled:hover:bg-accent/20`, `enabled:active:bg-accent/30`) because the overlay only reveals them on row hover while the row owns the pointer cursor.
- `ItemActions` never lets a click reach the parent row (stopPropagation on pointerdown/pointerup/click).
- A row hosting `ItemActions` is `relative` and `group/item`.
