# Frontend Events

## Role

Manages real-time event subscription, validation, and store updates. Events flow from backend during task execution, enabling live UI updates.

## Key Files

- `frontend/src/hooks/useSessionEvents.ts` — master event subscription hook
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useChatEvents.ts` — streaming, thoughts, errors, task lifecycle (task_complete, task_cancelled), `session_paused` (sets the per-session `paused` flag + clears `taskActive`, unlocking the input — SUPPRESSED while `chatStore.compacting[session]` is set, the manual-compaction flow's own pause), and `session_resumed` (clears the `paused` flag + sets `taskActive`, re-locking the input)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/usePlanEvents.ts` — plan generation, step lifecycle
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useToolEvents.ts` — tool call/result correlation and tool confirmation (`tool_confirm` via shared handlers)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useActionEvents.ts` — `ask_user`, step limits, resume actions (`task_failed_resumable`/`task_resumed`), and plan review (`plan_review_ready`) via shared handlers
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useContextEvents.ts` — context fill, compaction. Also owns the manual-compaction lifecycle: `compaction_started` sets `chatStore.compacting` + the "Compacting" activity, `compaction_finished` releases it (failure → "Compaction failed" label; a failed auto-resume → `paused_without_resume` re-applies the paused state, since `session_paused` was suppressed while compacting; any other outcome with nothing to resume — idle session including an idle no-op (`nothing_compacted`, no card follows), cancelled flow, plain success — clears the activity; a successful auto-resume or a deferral (`deferred_to_resume`) leaves the label to `task_resumed`); pure handlers `handleCompactionStarted`/`handleCompactionFinished` are shared-testable
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useLifecycleEvents.ts` — routing, step_start, step_complete, retry, step_retry
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useSubagentEvents.ts` — subagent lifecycle
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useBlackboardEvents.ts` — blackboard state updates
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useAttachmentEvents.ts` — attachment list updates
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/hitlHandlers.ts` — shared HITL event handlers (`handleToolConfirmEvent`, `handleAskUserEvent`, `handleStepLimitEvent`, `handlePlanReviewEvent`) used by `useToolEvents` (`tool_confirm`) and `useActionEvents` (`ask_user`/`step_limit`/`plan_review`), plus the background-session watcher
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useReviewRestore.ts` — restores code-review buffer state on session activation (reloads comments, reopens review page if mid-loop, reconciles stale loop flags)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useGoalEvents.ts` — goal-mode events (`goal_proposal` pending action + `goal_status`/`goal_progress` service-phase events → goalStore + chat message)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useSoundEvents.ts` — sound-notification events (plays Web Audio tones on task lifecycle milestones when `soundStore.enabled`); composed by `useSessionEvents`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useFileDrop.ts` — global `files:dropped` subscription, HTML5 drag overlay, and navigation suppression
- `frontend/src/hooks/useExitGuard.ts` — global `app:exit_requested` subscription (mounted once at the app root, above the per-phase renders): validates the intercepted-quit payload and writes `exitGuardStore`; a malformed payload is reported via `reportDroppedEvent` and still opens the generic list-less modal — the backend has already prevented the quit, so an unanswered dialog would leave the app unclosable. The user's decision travels back through the `ConfirmExit` RPC from `ExitConfirmDialog` (a pure view over the store; `update_pending` in the payload switches it to restart context)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useStageAttachments.ts` — shared picker/drop attachment staging and model-vision filtering
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/goalHandlers.ts` — shared goal event handlers (`handleGoalProposalEvent`, `handleGoalStatusEvent`, `handleGoalProgressEvent`) used by `useGoalEvents` (foreground) and the background-session watcher (mirrors the `hitlHandlers.ts` pattern)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/sessionLifecycleHandlers.ts` — shared session pause/resume handlers (`handleSessionPausedEvent`, `handleSessionResumedEvent`) used by `useChatEvents` (foreground) and the background-session watcher (mirrors the `hitlHandlers.ts` pattern)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useTerminalEvents.ts` — terminal output events; **component-mounted** by `terminal/Terminal.tsx` (not delegated by `useSessionEvents`)
- `frontend/src/hooks/events/useToolJudgeEvents.ts` — LLM judge response events; **component-mounted** by `chat/ToolConfirmation.tsx` (not delegated by `useSessionEvents`)
- `frontend/src/types/events.ts` — event payload type definitions
- `frontend/src/types/guards.ts` — type guard functions

## Behavior

### Subscription Composition

```
useSessionEvents(sessionId)
  ├─ On mount/sessionId change:
  │   ├─ Subscribe to session:${sessionId}:* events
  │   └─ Set up dispatch to type-specific handlers
  │
  ├─ Delegates to focused hooks (the 12 composed by useSessionEvents):
  │   ├─ useChatEvents → chatStore updates (streaming, thoughts, errors, task lifecycle)
  │   ├─ usePlanEvents → planStore updates
  │   ├─ useToolEvents → chatStore (tool messages, tool_confirm via hitlHandlers)
  │   ├─ useActionEvents → chatStore (pending actions: ask_user/step_limit/resume; plan_review via hitlHandlers)
  │   ├─ useContextEvents → chatStore (context fill, manual-compaction lifecycle)
  │   ├─ useLifecycleEvents → chatStore (routing, step_start/complete, retry)
  │   ├─ useSubagentEvents → planStore
  │   ├─ useBlackboardEvents → blackboardStore
  │   ├─ useAttachmentEvents → attachmentsStore
  │   ├─ useReviewRestore → reviewStore (restores code-review buffer on session activation)
  │   ├─ useGoalEvents → goalStore (goal status/progress) + chatStore (goal_proposal message, via goalHandlers)
  │   └─ useSoundEvents → sound playback (task lifecycle milestones, gated by soundStore.enabled)
  │
  │  (useTerminalEvents and useToolJudgeEvents are component-mounted, not
  │   orchestrator-delegated: Terminal.tsx and ToolConfirmation.tsx subscribe
  │   to their own session-scoped events directly)
  │
  └─ On unmount/sessionId change:
      └─ Unsubscribe all listeners
```

### Handler Pattern

Each event handler follows the same pattern:

```typescript
function handleAssistantChunk(data: unknown, sessionId: string) {
  // 1. Type guard validates payload
  if (!isAssistantChunkData(data)) return;

  // 2. Update activity status
  chatStore.setActivityStatus(sessionId, "Generating response...");

  // 3. Update domain-specific store
  chatStore.setStreamingText(sessionId, data.accumulated_content);

  // 4. Auto-scroll handled by ChatScrollManager component (not by event handlers)
}
```

### Streaming Flow

```
Backend emits assistant_chunk events (rapid, during LLM streaming):
  → handler accumulates text in chatStore.streamingText[sessionId]
  → component renders streaming text in real-time

Backend emits assistant_done (once, when LLM finishes):
  → handler calls chatStore.addMessage(sessionId, message) + chatStore.clearStreamingText(sessionId)
  → streaming state cleared
  → permanent ChatMessageUI added to message list
```

### Native File Drop

`files:dropped` is a global desktop event, not part of `useSessionEvents`. In chat input mode, `useFileDrop` validates `{paths, x, y}` and forwards a defensive copy of `paths` to `useStageAttachments` for the active session. That shared hook applies the same image/vision filtering and backend `AttachFiles` call as the native picker.

Document-level HTML5 `dragenter`/`dragover`/`dragleave`/`drop` listeners maintain a reference-counted overlay and suppress the webview's default open-file navigation. They do not read filesystem paths from `dataTransfer`; Wails native drop is the sole path source. Leaving chat mode unsubscribes the global event and clears drag state.

### Close Guard

`app:exit_requested` is a global desktop event: the Wails `OnBeforeClose` hook intercepted a quit because sessions have live work (running task or in-flight manual compaction; paused/unfinished tasks are persisted and don't count). `useExitGuard` — mounted once at the app root, above the per-phase renders — validates `{sessions, update_pending}` and opens `ExitConfirmDialog` over `exitGuardStore`; store-backed state survives the app-phase remounts of the dialog component. A malformed payload is reported via `reportDroppedEvent` and degrades to the generic list-less modal, because the backend has already prevented the quit and an unanswered dialog would leave the app unclosable. The user's answer travels back through the `ConfirmExit` RPC — never a response event, since the decision must reach the process that owns the exit-confirmed bypass flag. `update_pending: true` (the intercepted quit belongs to `ApplyUpdate`) switches the dialog to restart context; the backend marker self-expires with the staged updater's parent-wait window, so a cancelled-then-retried quit after it degrades to a plain quit.

### Pending Actions

Certain events create "pending actions" that require user response:

| Event          | Action Type          | UI                 | Response Event          |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `tool_confirm` | Tool confirmation    | Allow/Deny buttons | `tool_confirm_response` |
| `ask_user`     | Multi-question form  | Form with inputs   | `ask_user_response`     |
| `step_limit`   | Step budget decision | Allow/Deny/Always  | `step_limit_response`   |
| `goal_proposal` | Goal sign-off | Approve (with editable condition/verify textareas) / Cancel | `goal_proposal_response` (event) or `ConfirmGoal`/`CancelGoal` RPC — both funnel through one resolver |
| `plan_review_ready` | Plan review     | Approve/Request-Changes/Abandon + feedback | `plan_approval_response` event |

Pending actions are stored in chatStore and rendered by the PendingActionsBar component.

## Error Handling

- Invalid payload (type guard fails) → event silently dropped, logged in dev mode
- Event for wrong session → ignored (sessionId mismatch)
- Store update throws → caught by error boundary, logged

## Invariants

- Event handlers are pure functions (testable without React rendering)
- Type guards validate at ingestion point — downstream code is fully typed
- Only one subscription per session at a time (previous unsubscribed on change)
- Streaming state is per-session (multiple sessions don't interfere)
- Pending actions expire on task completion/cancellation
- Native file-drop paths originate only from the validated Wails `files:dropped` event; HTML5 drag events control overlay state and suppress navigation
- Picker and native drop share one attachment-staging/vision-filtering hook
- The per-session `paused` flag is set by `session_paused` and cleared by `session_resumed`/`task_resumed`/`task_cancelled`; a paused session unlocks the input and shows Resume + Stop (see [rendering.md](rendering.md))
