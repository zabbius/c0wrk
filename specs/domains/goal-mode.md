# Goal Mode

## Purpose

Goal mode is a multi-turn, agent-driven execution loop that pursues a single user-approved success condition to completion. Instead of a single route→Conductor pass that finishes when the agent calls `finish`, a goal request derives a crisp {condition, verify} pair (with user sign-off), then iterates the Conductor turn-by-turn until the agent **declares the goal met**, the **budget is exhausted**, the agent goes **idle (anti-spin)**, a turn keeps **erroring past its bounded retry** (a **resumable failure**), or the task is **paused** (a session-level control; see [Pause is Session-Level](#pause-is-session-level-universal-pause-signal)). Goal mode is selected by a leading `/goal` command or an explicit goal flag (e.g. a UI toggle) on any message — including a continuation message, in which case the goal loop runs on the restored blackboard of the prior task (see [Mechanism](#mechanism)).

## Key Files

- `core/goal/types.go` — the `goal` domain package: `GoalStatus`, `GoalBudget`, `GoalEvidence`, `Verdict`, `GoalState` (the runtime state machine; `VerificationMode` the per-goal `executable`/`re_derivation` mode + `NormalizeVerificationMode` the single source of truth for valid values / the empty→default mapping; `LastVerification` carries the independent-verifier outcome marker `""`/`confirmed`/`rejected`/`off`)
- `core/orchestrator_goal.go` — the goal loop: `deriveGoal`, `runGoalLoop`, `resumeGoalLoop`, `runGoalTurns`, budget/anti-spin logic, the `countingToolExec` wrapper (anti-spin tool-call counter), `emitGoalStatus`/`emitGoalProgress`; the **independent-verification gate** in `runGoalTurns` (the "met" branch); `goalLoopResult` (maps a mid-turn **session-pause** to `ExecutionStatusPaused`; maps a halted turn error to a resumable `ExecutionStatusFailed` carrying the error reason as the output); `defaultGoalVerifier` (the production verifier pass — runs on a **fresh isolated blackboard** seeded with the met turn's work product via `execResultOutput`/`SetFinalResult`, on the same complexity-derived step budget as a working turn, branching on `gs.VerificationMode`), `resolveGoalVerifier` (verifier nil→default resolution + test seam), `verifierToolFilter` (the group-based read-only/test toolset for `executable` mode: include `system + local_read + remote_read + execute + local_mcp + remote_mcp`; hard-exclude groups `local_write`/`remote_write` + goal-control names), `verifierReDerivationToolFilter` (adds `delegate` for `re_derivation` mode; `read_step_output` arrives via the `system` group in both modes), `goalVerifierDefaultRejectReason` (synthesized rejection reason), `renderReportedEvidence`; `ErrGoalBlockedByModelProfiles` — the sentinel returned when a goal (fresh, via `HandleMessage`'s goal branch, or resumed, at `resumeGoalLoop` entry) is attempted while the Model Profiles essential-tools narrowing is active (see [model-profiles.md](model-profiles.md#goal-mode-gate-goalblocked))
- `core/orchestrator.go` — `HandleMessage` dispatch (`opts.Goal`), `Resume` goal-loop branch, `WithGoalState`, `activePause atomic.Pointer[atomic.Bool]` field (the **universal cross-goroutine pause signal** — read by every conductor run's pause-checker at each step boundary; `PauseSession` flips it), `installPauseSignal`/`PauseSession`/`newPauseChecker`, `ApplyRequestOverrides` (shared step 0 for HandleMessage and the resume path), the `goalVerifier` field (the verifier injection seam), `GoalLoopSettings.Verification` (runtime config field mirroring the config layer)
- `core/message_preprocess.go` — `DetectAndStripGoalMode` (`/goal` prefix detection)
- `core/types.go` — `HandleOptions.Goal`, `HandleOptions.GoalBudgetOverride`
- `core/systemprompt.go` — goal-mode system-prompt section rendering (`prompts.GoalModeSubstitute`) and the derivation prompt selection (`prompts.GoalDerivation`); `renderGoalModeVolatile` (the per-turn volatile section, including the one-shot rejection notice when the prior "met" was rejected by the verifier); the derivation and verification Lite directives are selected through `buildSpecializedSystemPromptWithLite` (`prompts.GoalDerivationLite` / `GoalVerificationLiteDirectiveByMode`) when the Model Profiles `system_prompt` variant is active (see [model-profiles.md](model-profiles.md#system-prompt-simplification))
- `core/tools/propose_goal.go` — `propose_goal` tool + `GoalProposer` interface + context plumbing (`WithGoalProposer`/`GoalProposerFrom`)
- `core/tools/declare_goal_status.go` — `declare_goal_status` tool + `GoalStatusSink` interface + context plumbing (`WithGoalStatusSink`/`GoalStatusSinkFrom`) — the agent's **primary** self-evaluation verdict channel
- `core/tools/declare_verification.go` — `declare_verification` tool (`system`-group tool — the verifier's ONLY verdict channel) + `VerificationOutcome` + `VerificationSink` interface (`Declare`/`Last`) + context plumbing (`WithVerificationSink`/`VerificationSinkFrom`). Mirrors `declare_goal_status`'s evidence mandate (`confirmed=true` requires non-empty evidence)
- `core/prompts/goal_verification_substitute.go` — `GoalVerificationSubstitute` (resolves the shared `{goal_condition}`/`{goal_verify_clause}`/`{reported_evidence}`/`{shell_tool}` placeholders for BOTH verification directives) and `GoalVerificationDirectiveByMode` (the prompts-layer mode→directive mapping: `executable`/empty → `prompts.GoalVerification`, `re_derivation` → `prompts.GoalReDerivation`)
- `backend/config/config.go` / `backend/config/defaults.go` — `GoalLoopConfig.Verification` (`independent` default | `off`), validated in `Validate`
- `desktop/startup_phases.go` — `goalProposerAdapter` (the desktop `GoalProposer` that emits `goal_proposal` and blocks for the user response)
- `desktop/startup.go` — goal-proposal pending map, `goal_proposal_response` event handler, goal-proposal resolver wiring
- `backend/frontend_api_session.go` — session-level RPC surface: `PauseSession(sessionID)` / `ResumeSession(sessionID, modelOverride, reasoningEffort, nudge)` (the universal pause/resume controls — apply to **all** tasks, goal and non-goal alike); `SendMessage` / `ResumeTask` / `ResumeSession` also refuse a goal (explicit flag OR `/goal` prefix) and a paused-goal resume while the Model Profiles essential-tools narrowing is active (`modelProfilesGoalBlocked` / `goalResumeBlockedByModelProfiles`), before any side effect (see [model-profiles.md](model-profiles.md#goal-mode-gate-goalblocked))
- `backend/frontend_api_goal.go` — RPC surface: `ConfirmGoal`/`CancelGoal`; `ConfirmGoal` forwards the user-approved `verificationMode` through the proposal resolver
- `backend/session/manager_execution.go` — `PauseSession` (delegates to `Orchestrator.PauseSession`), `ResumeSession` (delegates to `ResumeTask`), `hasPausedUnfinishedTask` (the SendMessage nudge-resume router), `SessionRuntimeStatus.Paused`, the `session_paused`/`session_resumed` emissions
- `backend/session/manager_goal.go` — `SetGoalProposalResolver`, `ResolveGoalProposal`
- `backend/session/events.go` — `GoalProposalPayload` (echoes `VerificationMode` from the derivation proposal)

//   active        — in force; the agent is working toward it
//   met           — condition satisfied (terminal success)

}
```

## Mechanism

Goal mode is a three-phase loop. Entry is **per-message**: `HandleMessage` checks `opts.Goal` and dispatches to `runGoalLoop`. This holds on **both a fresh task (`TaskID == ""`) and a continuation (`TaskID != ""`)** — there is no `TaskID` gate.

- **Fresh task (`TaskID == ""`)** — the goal loop runs against a freshly-created blackboard; routing is decided by the full router (`routeOrContinue` falls through to `routeAndActivateSkills`).
- **Continuation (`TaskID != ""`)** — the goal loop runs **on the restored blackboard of the prior task**. The restored blackboard carries the inherited facts, the prior plan/trajectory, and the accumulated conversation history. A fresh `{condition, verify}` goal is derived from the new continuation message (with user sign-off), and routing is **reused** from the restored task via `routeOrContinue`'s continuation fast-path when the restored blackboard carries BOTH a plan and a routing decision (the router is blind to the restored plan and would misclassify a continuation message); when no plan/routing was persisted it falls through to the full router, exactly as a normal continuation does. In short: **goal on a continuation inherits the prior task's blackboard (facts, plan, trajectory, history) and routing, and derives a new goal from the new message.**

The continuation-inheritance semantics apply only on the goal-loop entry path (`runGoalLoop`); a non-goal continuation (`opts.Goal == false`) takes the normal Conductor continuation path unchanged. Goal state from the prior task is **not** inherited on a goal-on-continuation — a brand-new `GoalState` is derived from the new message and replaces any prior goal state, since the prior task had either completed (terminal) or never ran a goal loop.

### Phase 1 — Derivation (deriveGoal)

A full-context Conductor pass whose only job is to derive a crisp {condition, verify} goal from the user's request and submit it for user sign-off. It is a **Conductor run with a different instruction set**, not a separate engine:

1. The `GoalProposer` (desktop-supplied) is wrapped in a `capturingProposer` and injected into the Conductor context (`tools.WithGoalProposer`).
2. `ensureProposeGoalTool` guarantees the `propose_goal` tool descriptor is in the available-tool list (rebuilt from the registry if absent).
3. The Conductor system prompt is overridden with `prompts.GoalDerivation`; the rest of the Conductor wiring (context injection, trajectory, tool executor/registry) is reused.
4. `RunConductor` runs. The agent grounds the goal in the actual codebase using its normal read/search/probe tools, then calls `propose_goal` with `{condition, verify, verification_mode}` — `verification_mode` is `executable` (default) when the verify clause is runnable, or `re_derivation` when "done" must be proven by re-running an open-ended process. If the request is ambiguous, the derivation agent disambiguates it via `ask_user` (follow-up questions) **before** calling `propose_goal`.
5. `propose_goal` delegates to the `GoalProposer`, which emits a `goal_proposal` event and **blocks** until the user responds.
6. After the run, `buildGoalState` reconstructs the `GoalState` from the captured proposal + response. On "approve" it **prefers the user's edited condition/verify/verification_mode** over the agent's wording (unedited fields fall back to the proposal; the mode is normalized via `goal.NormalizeVerificationMode`, empty→`executable`). The budget is left unlimited here; caps are applied at activation.

If the agent never calls `propose_goal`, the run cancelled, or the user cancelled the proposal, `deriveGoal` returns an error and the loop exits cleanly with the original message as output.

### Phase 2 — Activation

`runGoalLoop` resolves the budget (`resolveGoalBudget`: applies `opts.GoalBudgetOverride` — `MaxTurns` when set, otherwise unlimited), stamps `Status = active`, and relies on the **universal session pause signal** (installed by `installPauseSignal` in `HandleMessage`/`Resume`, not a goal-specific signal). Activation itself does not checkpoint the `GoalState` — persistence happens at loop exit via `persistGoalStateBestEffort` (both `runGoalLoop` and `resumeGoalLoop`, after `runGoalTurns` returns), which covers the pause path as well as terminal outcomes. Conversation history is truncated once to the configured window; the trajectory accumulates across turns via the blackboard.

### Phase 3 — Turn iteration (runGoalTurns)

```
for gs.Status == active:
  ┌─ top of turn: ctx cancelled? → break (the request persists as paused)
  │
  ├─ run ONE turn via the turn runner (fresh Executor.Run via RunConductor)
  │   — every turn: ReAct+Conductor consuming the pre-established routing
  │   — NO turn routes — routing was decided once at the top of runGoalLoop,
  │     before derivation (re-routing a continuation misclassifies it; see Routing Invariant)
  │   — tool executor wrapped in countingToolExec (per-turn tool-call count for anti-spin)
  │   — context carries a fresh GoalStatusSink (declare_goal_status writes into it)
  │   — context carries the GoalState (WithGoalState) so the system prompt renders the goal.
  │     TurnCount is charged UP FRONT: turn N runs with gs.TurnCount == N, so the
  │     rendered budget line reads "turn N/…" (an earlier version incremented only
  │     AFTER the run, so every turn — turn 1 included — rendered "turn 0")
  │   — the turn's deps mark declare_goal_status as a STOP TOOL (conductorDeps.stopTools
  │     → ConductorConfig.StopTools → agent.Executor.SetStopTools): the moment the agent
  │     declares its verdict the run ENDS (Finished=true, the verdict call's observation
  │     as the turn output), so the turn is ONE bounded attempt. Without it the agent —
  │     prompted to keep going until the condition holds — packs the whole goal,
  │     including its own verification loop, into a single unbounded turn: TurnCount
  │     never advances (the UI sits on turn 0) and MaxTurns never engages
  │   — the universal pause-checker reads activePause at each step boundary:
  │     PauseSession flips it → the conductor stops mid-turn with ErrPaused →
  │     ExecutionStatusPaused; runGoalTurns sees the paused turn result and
  │     breaks out (goal Status stays active — the pause is task-level)
  │
  ├─ was the turn paused (ExecutionStatusPaused)? → break out of the loop
  │   (the request returns ExecutionStatusPaused; the session manager persists
  │   the task as paused + emits session_paused; the goal stays "active" so a
  │   later ResumeSession re-enters the goal loop via resumeGoalLoop)
  │
  ├─ did the turn ERROR (turnRunner err != nil)? → branch BEFORE the
  │   verdict / anti-spin / budget logic (an errored turn is NOT idle):
  │     retry a bounded number of times (goalTurnMaxErrorRetries); once the
  │     retries are exhausted, break leaving the goal ACTIVE (non-terminal)
  │     and record the cause on gs.LastError → goalLoopResult maps it to a
  │     RESUMABLE FAILURE (ExecutionStatusFailed → task_failed_resumable),
  │     never blocked_idle / partial. A later Resume re-enters and retries.
  │
  ├─ read the verdict sink:
  │     "met"     → INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION GATE (see § Independent Verification):
  │                  ┌─ verification "off" → Status=met, break (evidence-mandate-only)
  │                  ├─ verifier resolved (resolveGoalVerifier; nil seam → confirm)
  │                  ├─ confirmed → Status=met, break (the agent's verdict stands)
  │                  └─ rejected (Confirmed=false, nil outcome, or error)
  │                       → synthesize not_met {reason} into gs.LastVerdict,
  │                         set gs.LastVerification="rejected", emit goal_status,
  │                         CONTINUE the loop (no break, no TurnCount re-increment
  │                         — the agent turn already counted; falls through to
  │                         anti-spin / budget guards). A rejected "met" can
  │                         NEVER terminate the goal as met.
  │     "blocked" → Status=blocked_idle, break
  │     "not_met" → keep iterating
  │
  ├─ anti-spin: toolCalls == 0 AND no verdict AND no turn error → Status=blocked_idle, break
  │
  ├─ budget check (only when an explicit cap is set):
  │     MaxTurns > 0 && TurnCount >= MaxTurns → Status=exhausted, break
  │     (MaxTurns == 0 = unlimited: NO turn cap; the user controls it via pause/stop)
  │
  └─ emit goal_progress (turn/budget telemetry) + goal_status (full snapshot)
```

A turn **error is retried a bounded number of times** (`goalTurnMaxErrorRetries`); if it keeps failing, the loop halts leaving the goal **active** (non-terminal) so the task is a **resumable failure** (`ExecutionStatusFailed` → the manager's `task_failed_resumable` banner), recording the concrete cause on `GoalState.LastError` and surfacing it as the task output — never `blocked_idle` / `partial`. The Conductor's conversation history accumulates across turns via the blackboard, so dialogue context is preserved.

## Routing Invariant (One Routing Decision per Goal Task)

Routing is established **exactly once, at the top of `runGoalLoop`, before the derivation pass**, and inherited unchanged by derivation and every goal turn. It is **never** re-done on a continuation turn.

**What happens, once.** `runGoalLoop`'s first act — before `deriveGoal` — is `routeOrContinue`, the same continuation-aware routing helper the normal `HandleMessage` path uses:

- **Fresh task (`opts.TaskID == ""`)** — no restored routing exists, so `routeOrContinue` falls through to `routeAndActivateSkills`, a full routing pass that classifies the message and activates skills.
- **Continuation (`opts.TaskID != ""`)** — when the restored blackboard carries BOTH a plan and a routing decision, `routeOrContinue` reuses the routing via its continuation fast-path and **does not** re-run the router; when neither is persisted it falls through to the full router. This is the same behavior the normal continuation path has; the goal loop just inherits it.

Either way, the routing pass (when it runs) produces the `RoutingDecision`: **domain** (`code`/`research`/`general`/`mixed`), **complexity** (`[1,5]`), and **matched skills**; merges in **user-specified skills** (`opts.UserSkills`); enriches the context (`WithDomain`, `WithComplexity`, `WithActiveSkills`, `WithUserSkills`) and persists the decision (`SetRouting`) so finalization and resume see it.

That enriched context is then threaded into **`deriveGoal` and every goal turn** (`runGoalTurns`). The turn runner (`defaultGoalTurnRunner` → `RunConductor`) only *consumes* routing from the context — it never calls the router. So **no turn, turn 1 included, re-routes**.

**Why route before derive (and never again).**

- **Derivation must ground the goal against the real domain and active skills.** A `code` goal should frame `verify` around `go test`/`go lint` evidence; a `research` goal around qualitative artifacts. The derivation agent also needs the active-skill instructions in its system prompt to shape a realistic {condition, verify} pair. Routing first means derivation sees the same domain context + skills the working turns will.
- **Turns need domain/complexity for step-limit and compaction.** `RunConductor` derives the per-turn ReAct step ceiling from complexity (`stepsPerComplexity = 30`, i.e. `complexity × 30`) and the compaction strategy from domain+complexity (`compactionStrategyForDomain`). Both come from the single routing decision carried on the context.
- **Skills drive tool-policy overrides.** Skill-activated policy overrides are applied once at routing time and inherited by every turn's registry; re-routing would re-apply (or drop) them mid-goal.

**The invariant — one routing decision per goal task.** This mirrors the normal orchestrator's continuation fast-path (`routeOrContinue` skips the router when a restored task already has a routing decision): a goal-loop turn's message is a continuation of the same task, not a new request. Re-routing it would misclassify a continuation (e.g. the router sees "continue working" and picks a different domain/complexity), destabilizing the system prompt and skill set mid-goal. Note that on a **goal-on-continuation** entry (a continuation message with `opts.Goal == true`), routing is reused from the restored task at the top of `runGoalLoop` via `routeOrContinue` — the goal loop never re-routes the inherited routing. See [../decisions/019-goal-mode.md](../decisions/019-goal-mode.md) §6 and [orchestration/router.md](orchestration/router.md) (continuation fast-path) for the rationale.

**Resume reuses, never re-routes.** `resumeGoalLoop` receives the persisted `RoutingDecision` and re-installs it (`SetRouting`) **without** calling `routeOrContinue`/`routeAndActivateSkills`; when none was persisted it falls back to the `general` domain. A resumed goal therefore continues under the same routing it was started with.

## Self-Evaluation: `declare_goal_status`

The single channel through which the loop learns a structured verdict is the `declare_goal_status` tool (a `system`-group tool — bypasses policy and the tool judge). It writes a typed `goal.Verdict` into the per-turn `GoalStatusSink`; the loop reads the sink after each turn. The tool is also the turn's **stop tool**: a successful call ends the turn's `Executor.Run`, and the loop charges the turn budget and advances.

**Evidence mandate**: declaring status `"met"` **requires non-empty evidence** — at least one `{type, ref, summary}` artifact (changed file path, test output, command result). Enforced at the tool boundary so a bare "done" can never terminate the goal loop without a concrete, inspectable artifact. The tool executor does **not** validate inputs against the JSON schema, so the check rejects both an absent array **and** a present-but-empty entry (e.g. `evidence:[{}]` or `evidence:[{"ref":""}]`): each entry must have non-empty `type`, `ref`, and `summary` after trimming. A `met` verdict that fails this check is rejected with an error and the loop keeps iterating.

**The working agent does NOT act as its own verifier.** The evidence mandate asks it to cite the artifacts its work produced or that it observed — it is **not** asked to run a private verification cycle over the Verify Clause (that clause is the *independent verifier's* test; see § Independent Verification). The prompt (goal_mode.md § *Evidence Mandate*) explicitly says so, because prompting the working agent to self-verify makes it re-run the clause, fix, and re-run inside a single turn — the exact behavior that defeated the turn boundary. The agent declares its honest assessment with evidence; the independent verifier re-checks every `met`.

The agent is self-evaluating its own work — see the ADR for the rationale (self-agent + evidence-mandate as the primary verdict, with an independent verification backstop).

## Independent Verification

The agent's `declare_goal_status` verdict is the **primary** signal, but it is a single unverified assertion — a sufficiently convincing agent can declare `"met"` with fabricated-but-plausible evidence. An **independent verification backstop** re-checks each claimed `"met"` before the goal terminates. It is the mechanism Decision 1 of [../decisions/019-goal-mode.md](../decisions/019-goal-mode.md) adopts: a verifier that is **as capable as the executor** (full step budget), **isolated from the active task** (fresh blackboard), **read-only/test** (mutating and goal-control tools excluded), and **mode-driven** (`executable`/`re_derivation`).

**When it runs.** Only after the agent declares `"met"` **with evidence** (i.e. the evidence mandate already passed). It runs **once per claimed "met"**, never on every turn, and never on `not_met`/`blocked`/idle turns.

**What it is — a control-plane pass, NOT a goal turn.** The verifier is an **isolated `RunConductor` pass** launched inside the held single-flight, **between two agent turns** (`defaultGoalVerifier`). It is explicitly **not** a goal-loop turn:

- It does **not** increment `TurnCount` and is **not** counted against `MaxTurns`. A rejected `"met"` therefore costs the budget **one agent turn + one verifier pass** (the agent turn already counted; the verifier is off the turn budget). Note the verifier's own per-pass *step* budget is full (see below) — only the *turn* budget is unaffected.
- It does **not** route — it inherits the routing decision established once at goal entry (see [Routing Invariant](#routing-invariant-one-routing-decision-per-goal-task)). It is part of the control plane that *governs* the turn loop, not part of it.
- It inherits the **active skills + project-context prefix** via `buildSpecializedSystemPrompt` over the mode-selected directive (resolved by `GoalVerificationSubstitute` with the condition, the verify clause, and the agent's **reported evidence presented as unverified claims** via `renderReportedEvidence` to re-check).
- It is built from **fresh Conductor deps** (`buildConductorDeps`, `resumeSteps = nil`) — it never resumes from a checkpoint.

**Capability parity — a full step budget, not a tight probe.** The verifier runs on the **same complexity-derived step budget as a normal executor run** (`complexity × stepsPerComplexity`), not a small fixed cap. A shallow, cheap probe cannot catch a fabricated-but-plausible "met"; only a genuinely capable re-check can. (The earlier `verificationMaxSteps` fixed cap was removed for exactly this reason.)

**Isolation from the active task — a fresh, seeded blackboard.** The verifier runs on a **fresh blackboard** (`orchestration.NewMapBlackboard`), **not** the goal loop's blackboard. It therefore sees none of the still-active task's incomplete state (partial plan, pending step outputs). It is **seeded with the met turn's work product** — extracted by `execResultOutput` (the model's own final text, `ExecutionResult.Summary`, when the turn ended on the `declare_goal_status` stop tool; otherwise the run's `Output`) and written via `SetFinalResult`, with the original request via `SetOriginalRequest` — so the verifier can inspect what was actually produced (its own `read_final_result` returns the real work, not the stop tool's short confirmation string) without depending on the working session's live trajectory.

**Mode-driven verification.** *How* the verifier checks "done" is set per goal at derivation time (`GoalState.VerificationMode`, editable by the user at the approval step). The directive + toolset are selected together:

- **`executable` (default)** — the verify clause is a runnable predicate. The verifier independently re-runs it. Directive: `prompts.GoalVerification`; toolset: `verifierToolFilter` — a **group-based** include set (`system ∪ local_read ∪ remote_read ∪ execute ∪ local_mcp ∪ remote_mcp` + `declare_verification`; the `execute` group supplies the platform shell tool `bash_exec`/`posh_exec` so it can re-run e.g. `go test`). `delegate` is **excluded**.
- **`re_derivation`** — "done" cannot be settled by one command; it must be proven by re-running an open-ended process whose clean outcome is itself the proof. The verifier **delegates a fresh, read-only execution of the goal's process** via `delegate` and confirms *only* if that run comes back clean, citing the delegated run's own findings (read via `read_step_output`). Directive: `prompts.GoalReDerivation`; toolset: `verifierReDerivationToolFilter` (the `executable` toolset **plus** `delegate`; `read_step_output` is already present via the `system` group).

Both directives share the `{goal_condition}`/`{goal_verify_clause}`/`{reported_evidence}`/`{shell_tool}` placeholder set (resolved by `GoalVerificationSubstitute`); the prompts-layer mode→directive mapping lives in `GoalVerificationDirectiveByMode`.

**Read-only mandate.** Both modes hard-exclude by **group** — the mutating groups `local_write` and `remote_write` are excluded wholesale — plus two name-level exclusions: the goal-control/coordination names (`declare_goal_status`, `declare_step_complete`, `declare_plan`, `execute_plan`, `subagent`, `propose_goal`, `reflect`, `cancel_delegation`) that live in the otherwise-included `system` group, and the classic mutating builtins (`write_file`, `edit_file`, `delete_file`, `delete_directory`, `create_directory`) as a mis-tagging backstop (a mutating builtin accidentally tagged into an included group still cannot reach the verifier). The verifier's ONLY output channel is `declare_verification`; it cannot loop the loop, change the goal it is judging, or escape its read-only mandate. (In `re_derivation` mode `delegate` is the sole coordination tool permitted, so the verifier can spawn a read-only sub-agent.) Group semantics per [../decisions/024-group-policies.md](../decisions/024-group-policies.md).

**The verdict — `declare_verification` into a `VerificationSink`.** The verifier reports a `tools.VerificationOutcome {Confirmed, Reason, Evidence, DeclaredAt}` through `declare_verification` (a `system`-group tool, mirroring `declare_goal_status`) into a fresh per-pass `VerificationSink` (`memVerificationSink`). A confirmed verdict **requires non-empty evidence**, mirroring the evidence mandate on the agent's own `"met"` — the verifier must back its confirmation with concrete artifacts too. A pass that ends **without** declaring a verdict (hit the step budget, errored, or context cancelled) is treated as a **REJECT** — the condition could not be independently confirmed. **Exception — a cooperative pause.** A pass that ends in a **cooperative pause** (the universal pause signal tripped at a step boundary inside the verifier's own executor, or inside a `re_derivation` delegate it spawned) declared no verdict but was **interrupted, not refuted**: `defaultGoalVerifier` detects it via `pausedRun(err, result)` and returns the pause sentinel (`agent.ErrPaused`) with a **nil** outcome rather than a synthetic reject. `runGoalTurns` maps that to a **pause of the request** — the goal stays `active` and the session emits `session_paused` — so a paused verification is **never** misread as "the condition could not be confirmed" and never synthesizes a `not_met` verdict. `Resume` re-enters the loop and re-runs verification (settling the verifier's units).

**The gate in `runGoalTurns`.** The `"met"` branch is intercepted:

- **`verification: "off"`** → `Status=met`, break (evidence-mandate-only behavior; reproduces the original loop exactly).
- **No verifier resolved** (`resolveGoalVerifier` returns nil — the defensive seam) → `Status=met`, break (treated as confirmed).
- **Confirmed** → `Status=met`, break. The agent's verdict stands; termination is unchanged from the pre-verifier behavior (plus one verifier pass).
- **Paused** (the verifier pass ended in a cooperative pause — `isPaused(verr)`, the sentinel `defaultGoalVerifier` returns on a `pausedRun`) → the goal is **not** rejected: `paused=true` and the loop **breaks**, leaving the goal `active`. `goalLoopResult` maps it to `ExecutionStatusPaused`, so the manager persists the task as paused and emits `session_paused`. No `not_met` is synthesized; `Resume` re-enters and re-runs verification. Checked **before** the confirm/reject branches.
- **Rejected** (`Confirmed==false`, a nil outcome, or a non-pause error) → the `"met"` is overridden: a synthesized `not_met` verdict carrying the rejection reason (the verifier's `Reason`, or `goalVerifierDefaultRejectReason` when none) is assigned to `gs.LastVerdict`, `gs.LastVerification` is set to `"rejected"`, `goal_status` is emitted, and the loop **CONTINUES** — no break, no `TurnCount` re-increment (the agent turn already counted). The turn then falls through to the normal anti-spin / budget guards. **A `"met"` rejected by the verifier can never terminate the goal as met.**

**Rejection feedback to the next agent turn.** The marker `gs.LastVerification` (`""` / `"confirmed"` / `"rejected"` / `"off"`) is the single value threaded through two consumers. It is reset to `""` at the top of each agent turn — **after** that turn's prompt already rendered the prior marker — so the rejection notice is **one-shot**: it surfaces on exactly the turn after the rejected `"met"` claim, then is gone. `renderGoalModeVolatile` (`core/systemprompt.go`) reads `LastVerification == "rejected"` and prepends a prominent notice — *"Previous met claim was REJECTED by independent verification: \<reason\>. Address this before re-declaring met."* (reason from the synthesized `gs.LastVerdict.Reason`) — before the budget line. `emitGoalStatus` carries the same marker out via the `verification` field of the `goal_status` event (see [Events](#events)). This makes the rejection visible to exactly the one turn that must address it, without trajectory-plumbing.

**Configuration.** Two knobs: the **global on/off gate** `goal_loop.verification` (`independent` default | `off`), defined in `backend/config/config.go` (`GoalLoopConfig`), defaulted in `backend/config/defaults.go`, validated in `Validate`, surfaced at runtime as `GoalLoopSettings.Verification`; and the **per-goal `VerificationMode`** (`executable`/`re_derivation`), chosen at derivation, normalized by `goal.NormalizeVerificationMode`, and stored on `GoalState` — which only matters while the gate is `independent`. See [Budgets](#budgets) / [Configuration](#configuration).

                    (budget)    (resumable)

  A cooperative session-pause (PauseSession) does NOT change the goal status —
  the goal stays "active". It persists the TASK as paused (task-level checkpoint),
  emits session_paused, and releases single-flight. ResumeSession re-enters the
  goal loop (resumeGoalLoop) under the still-"active" goal. Pause/resume is
  therefore a session-level control, not a goal-status transition.
```

There is no `paused` goal status — pause is a **session-level** control via the universal pause signal (a mid-turn pause maps to `ExecutionStatusPaused` in `goalLoopResult` and leaves the goal `active`; see [Pause is Session-Level](#pause-is-session-level-universal-pause-signal)). Terminal states (`met`, `exhausted`, `cancelled`) are never re-entered — `Resume` guards on `IsTerminal()` before delegating to `resumeGoalLoop`. `blocked_idle` is resumable: a blocked goal is re-activated to `active` on resume so the `for gs.Status == active` guard enters the loop.

## Budgets

`GoalBudget` caps the resources the agent may spend. **It is turn-only**: the single dimension is `MaxTurns`, and `MaxTurns == 0` means "unlimited". The agent stops only when the turn cap is exceeded.

- **Resolution**: `resolveGoalBudget(opts.GoalBudgetOverride)` — the override sets MaxTurns when it is non-zero; a nil override (or `MaxTurns == 0`) means unlimited. There are no config-level defaults now; the budget is resolved entirely from the per-message override.
- **Override path**: parsed from a JSON string in `SendMessage`'s goal-budget field (`backend/session/manager_execution.go` `parseGoalBudget`); an empty/invalid string falls back to unlimited so a malformed budget never blocks a send. The frontend `BudgetCombobox` offers ∞ / 3 / 5 / 10 turns plus a custom turn-count input, producing `{"max_turns":N}`.
- **Unlimited means unlimited**: an unlimited goal (`MaxTurns == 0`) has **no internal turn cap**. The user controls it via pause/stop — selecting ∞ signals the intent to monitor and interrupt manually, not a hidden ceiling. The non-numeric guards that can halt an unlimited goal are the anti-spin `blocked_idle` halt (zero tool calls + no verdict, no error) and the bounded turn-error retry exhaustion (which halts as a resumable failure, not `blocked_idle`).

Budgets are applied at **activation (turn 1)**, not at derivation — derivation only decides WHAT the goal is, not how much it may cost.

## Anti-Spin

A turn that made **zero tool calls AND declared no verdict AND returned no error** is idle — the agent is stuck and further turns would likely repeat the same non-action. The loop halts such a turn as `blocked_idle` rather than spinning. The per-turn tool-call count comes from the `countingToolExec` wrapper installed around the turn's tool executor. A turn that returned an **error** is NOT idle: the error branch runs first (before the verdict / anti-spin / budget logic), so an errored turn is retried a bounded number of times and, if it keeps failing, halts leaving the goal `active` as a **resumable failure** — it can never be misclassified as `blocked_idle` or a bare "partial".

## Persistence & Resume

The `GoalState` is persisted so a paused/active goal survives app restart and resumes into the loop. It is **best-effort** (`persistGoalStateBestEffort`): a missing task store or task ID (tests, non-persistent sessions) is a no-op, and a persistence failure is logged but never propagates — losing the checkpoint degrades only resumability, not the current run.

- **Persistence contract**: `PersistableBlackboard`/`TaskPersistence` (`core/persistent_blackboard.go`) — `PersistGoalState(taskID, gs)` / `LoadGoalState(taskID)`. The restored state is carried on `TaskState.GoalState` (nil for non-goal tasks). See [memory/blackboard.md](memory/blackboard.md).
- **Resume entry**: `Orchestrator.Resume` checks `goalState != nil && !goalState.Status.IsTerminal()` and delegates to `resumeGoalLoop` (non-terminal) instead of the plain Conductor path. Terminal statuses fall through to normal resume.
- **`resumeGoalLoop`** mirrors `runGoalLoop`'s post-derivation body but skips `deriveGoal` — the condition and verify clause are already known. A `blocked_idle` goal is re-activated to `active` (a cooperative session-pause leaves the goal `active` already, so no re-activation is needed on that path). The prior trajectory (`resumeSteps`) is seeded into the executor on the **first resumed turn** via a once-flag wrapper so the resumed run continues the step counter/history from the checkpoint; the turn counter continues from `gs.TurnCount` (not reset to 1). Subsequent turns rely on the Conductor's own accumulated trajectory.
- **Backend resume**: `ResumeSession` → `ResumeTask` loads the unfinished task + persisted `GoalState` and dispatches to the orchestrator's resume path. See [session-lifecycle.md](session-lifecycle.md).
- **Failure vs pause — both non-terminal, so Resume re-enters.** A **turn-error halt** (bounded retries exhausted) leaves the goal `active` and `goalLoopResult` maps it to a resumable `ExecutionStatusFailed` carrying the cause (`GoalState.LastError` → the task output); a **cooperative pause** — including one that trips inside the verifier — leaves the goal `active` and maps to `ExecutionStatusPaused` (`session_paused`). Neither is terminal and neither is `blocked_idle`/`partial`. The verifier is an isolated Conductor pass, so its units are durably recorded through the task's unit ledger (namespaced `goal_verification`, parent-linked), which lets its work survive a restart. See [ADR-048](../decisions/048-unified-recovery-ledger.md).

## Events

Goal mode uses dedicated session events: one for the proposal sign-off (`goal_proposal`) and two for loop telemetry (`goal_status` / `goal_progress`). Each is its own event type emitted via a dedicated `Emitter` method — they do not ride the phase-discriminated `service` channel.

| Event | Direction | Payload | Source | Description |
| ----- | --------- | --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `goal_proposal` | backend → frontend | `GoalProposalPayload {request_id, session_id, condition, verify, verification_mode?}` | `goalProposerAdapter.Propose` | Derivation agent called `propose_goal`; surfaces as a pending action that **blocks the agent** until the user responds. `verification_mode` echoes the derivation agent's chosen `executable`/`re_derivation`. Persisted (role `goal_proposal`) so it reappears on reload. |
| `goal_proposal_response` | frontend → backend | `{request_id, decision, condition?, verify?, verification_mode?}` (`approve` / `cancel`) | `GoalProposalPanel` (Approve/Cancel) | User's sign-off decision (the user may edit `verification_mode` on approval). Both the event path and the RPC path (`ConfirmGoal`/`CancelGoal`) funnel through a single resolver on the desktop pending map. |
| `goal_status` | backend → frontend | dedicated `goal_status` session event, payload: `{status, turn, condition, max_turns, verification_mode, created_at?, verdict?, reason?, evidence?, verification?, verification_reason?, verification_evidence?}` | `emitGoalStatus` (`Emitter.GoalStatus`) | Full goal snapshot, emitted on every goal-state transition (met/exhausted/blocked_idle) and after each turn. A cooperative session-pause does **not** emit a goal-state transition (the goal stays `active`; the pause surfaces as `session_paused` instead). The `verification` field carries the independent-verifier outcome (`"confirmed"` / `"rejected"` / `"off"`) — present only when `gs.LastVerification` is one of those three values, i.e. immediately after a claimed `"met"` was adjudicated. `verification_mode` echoes `gs.VerificationMode`. `verdict`/`reason` reflect `gs.LastVerdict`; on a rejection, the synthesized `not_met` verdict carries the verifier's rejection reason. `verification_reason`/`verification_evidence` (present on `"confirmed"`) surface WHY the verifier confirmed and the artifacts backing it. `created_at` (UnixMilli, omitted when zero) is the goal run's identity — a fresh run gets a new `CreatedAt` while a resumed run keeps the persisted one — so the frontend can order turn counts unambiguously across consecutive goal runs. Persisted (role `goal_status`) so the frontend can rebuild the goal store after a session reload. |
| `goal_progress` | backend → frontend | dedicated `goal_progress` session event, payload: `{turn, max_turns, condition}` | `emitGoalProgress` (`Emitter.GoalProgress`) | Mid-loop turn/budget telemetry (emitted after a non-terminal turn). Not persisted (transient). |

`goal_status` and `goal_progress` are each their **own dedicated session event**, emitted via the dedicated `Emitter.GoalStatus` / `Emitter.GoalProgress` methods (not the phase-discriminated `service` channel) so the frontend's live subscription reaches the goal store reliably. The frontend goal store (`useGoalEvents`) reconciles the store from these events for the **active** session, and `useBackgroundSessionWatcher` routes the same `goal_status`/`goal_progress` events through the shared goal handlers for every **background** session — so the goal store (the status-bar `GoalStatusIndicator` badge and the turn progress) stays current for every live session, regardless of which one is in front; a session switch therefore renders the true goal status immediately rather than only after the asynchronous persisted-history rebuild (`rebuildGoalFromHistory`, which carries at most the last persisted turn snapshot). The `goal_proposal` event is handled by the same goal handlers hook, which writes both the goal store and a chat message (`goal_proposal` DisplayItem). See [../contracts/event-catalog.md](../contracts/event-catalog.md) and [frontend/events.md](frontend/events.md).

## Per-Turn `Executor.Run` Invariant

**Each goal-loop turn launches a fresh `Executor.Run`** (via `RunConductor`). The goal loop does **not** hold one long-lived executor across turns — it is a turn-of-Conductors, not a single multi-turn executor. Consequences:

- A turn is ONE bounded attempt and ends when the agent **declares its verdict**. The turn's executor marks `declare_goal_status` as a **stop tool** (`Executor.SetStopTools`), so a successful declaration terminates the run (`Finished=true`, the declaration's observation as the turn output) — the loop then reads the verdict and starts the next turn (a new `Executor.Run`). The terminator fires inside `batch` sub-calls too and honours the executor's finish-join guard (a pending-async rejection nudges and retries instead of terminating), so the boundary cannot be bypassed by batching the declaration or by abandoning pending work. The model-facing prompt states the same protocol (goal_mode.md § *One Attempt Per Turn*): the **goal-turn completion directive** replaces whichever completion block the mode selector would otherwise emit for the run — on a **fresh** goal turn that is the plan-context block (`OrchestratorPlanContext`, emitted because `prepareRequestContext` always sets `PlanModeKey`), and on a **resumed** goal turn the generic single-step "call `finish`" directive (the resume path does not set `PlanModeKey`). `finish` remains available and still ends a turn, but a turn whose **only** action is `finish` (or a bare text turn) makes **zero tool calls** and declares no verdict, so the anti-spin guard halts the goal as `blocked_idle` (a **terminal** status) — `finish` does not "just spend a turn" on its own; only a `finish` preceded by at least one tool call advances the loop without a verdict.
- The Conductor's conversation history accumulates across turns via the blackboard trajectory (the same mechanism normal continuation resume uses), so dialogue context is preserved across the turn boundary despite each turn being a fresh executor.
- No turn routes. Routing (domain, complexity, matched+user skills) is decided exactly once at the top of `runGoalLoop` — before derivation — and inherited unchanged by every turn; re-routing a continuation message would misclassify it. See [Routing Invariant](#routing-invariant-one-routing-decision-per-goal-task).
- The goal state and a fresh `GoalStatusSink` are injected into each turn's context (`WithGoalState`, `WithGoalStatusSink`); the system prompt renders the goal-mode section from the `GoalState` on every turn.

This is the same continuation convention the normal resume path uses (separate `Executor.Run`, trajectory-seeded), extended to iterate until the goal terminates.

> **The independent verifier is a fresh `RunConductor`, but NOT a goal turn.** The [Independent Verification](#independent-verification) backstop also launches an isolated `RunConductor` pass — but it is a **control-plane** pass, not one of the per-turn `Executor.Run`s this invariant covers: it does not increment `TurnCount`, is not counted against `MaxTurns`, and runs only after a claimed `"met"` with evidence.

## Pause is Session-Level (Universal Pause Signal)

Pause/resume is a **session-level** control, not a goal-level one. A single universal pause signal — `Orchestrator.activePause atomic.Pointer[atomic.Bool]` — serves **every** request (goal and non-goal alike). There is no goal-specific `PauseGoal`; the frontend `PauseSession`/`ResumeSession` RPCs drive the same mechanism for all tasks.

- **One signal, every conductor run.** `installPauseSignal()` (called via `defer` at the top of both `HandleMessage` and `Resume`) installs a fresh `*atomic.Bool` and returns a clear function that stores `nil` on exit. Every conductor run launched during the request — a normal Conductor pass, a goal-loop turn, or the verifier pass — receives a **pause-checker** (`newPauseChecker`, wired into `ConductorConfig.PauseChecker`) that reads `activePause` live at **each step boundary** (mid-turn, not only at the top of a turn).
- **Pause is cooperative and mid-turn.** `PauseSession()` loads the pointer and sets the `atomic.Bool` to `true`. The next step-boundary check in the in-flight conductor run observes it and the executor stops with `ErrPaused`, which the Conductor maps to **`ExecutionStatusPaused`**. The request path then persists the task as paused (`persistTaskOutcome` → `pbb.PauseTask()`) and exits, releasing the single-flight lock so a later `ResumeSession` can re-enter. The session manager emits `session_paused`.
- **Goal stays "active"; pause is task-level.** A cooperative pause does **not** transition the `GoalStatus` to `paused` — the goal remains `active`. In `runGoalTurns`, a turn whose conductor returns `ExecutionStatusPaused` causes the loop to `break` out (returning `paused=true`), and `goalLoopResult` maps that to `ExecutionStatusPaused` (not `Partial`). The persisted checkpoint + still-`active` goal mean a later `ResumeSession` re-enters `resumeGoalLoop` under the same goal.
- **Signal lifetime**: installing a fresh signal per request (rather than reusing one) guarantees a stale `true` value from a prior request can never pause a future one. The field is an `atomic.Pointer[atomic.Bool]` — **not** a bare pointer — because the write (in the `HandleMessage`/`Resume` goroutine) and the flip (in `PauseSession`, a Wails-RPC goroutine) are **not** both covered by the single-flight guard; the atomic pointer makes the entry/exit swap race-free.
- **No concurrent HandleMessage**: the request holds single-flight for its whole run, so a second `HandleMessage` on the same orchestrator returns `ErrRequestInFlight` until the request pauses/exits. Pause/Resume (and the nudge-resume path) is the intended control flow, not concurrent requests.
- **Resume re-enters the loop**: `ResumeSession` → `ResumeTask` loads the unfinished task + persisted `GoalState` and dispatches to the orchestrator's `Resume`, which installs its own fresh pause signal; when it sees a non-terminal `GoalState` it calls `resumeGoalLoop`, which continues the loop under the still-`active` goal. The optional `nudge` (a user message sent into the paused session) is injected as a trailing user message into the first resumed turn.

## Configuration

The goal budget is **turn-only**. There are no config-level token or wall-clock caps; a per-goal turn limit is selected in the UI (`BudgetCombobox`: ∞ / 3 / 5 / 10 turns, or a custom number). An unlimited goal (∞) has **no internal turn cap** — the user controls it via pause/stop. The independent verifier has two knobs: a global on/off gate (`goal_loop.verification`) and a per-goal `VerificationMode` (see [Independent Verification](#independent-verification)).

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `HandleOptions.GoalBudgetOverride` | nil | Per-request JSON override (`{"max_turns":N}`); `MaxTurns` when set, otherwise unlimited |
| `goal_loop.verification` | `independent` | **Global on/off gate.** Whether the independent verification backstop re-checks each claimed `"met"` before the goal terminates. `independent` (default): run the verifier pass — a rejected/ non-declaring verdict keeps the loop going; `off`: rely solely on the agent's `declare_goal_status` verdict + the evidence mandate (reproduces the pre-verifier loop). Defined in `backend/config/config.go` (`GoalLoopConfig`), defaulted in `backend/config/defaults.go`, validated in `Validate` (`independent`/`off`), surfaced at runtime as `OrchestratorConfig.GoalLoop.Verification` (`GoalLoopSettings`). |
| `GoalState.VerificationMode` | `executable` | **Per-goal mode** (only matters while `goal_loop.verification` is `independent`). Chosen at derivation via `propose_goal`, normalized by `goal.NormalizeVerificationMode`, stored on `GoalState`, and editable by the user at the approval step. `executable` (default): the verifier independently re-runs the runnable verify clause (`verifierToolFilter`); `re_derivation`: the verifier delegates a fresh read-only run of the goal's process and confirms only on a clean outcome (`verifierReDerivationToolFilter`). |

## Invariants

- Goal mode is **per-message, both fresh and continuation**: `opts.Goal` (no `TaskID` gate). A goal on a continuation runs on the **restored blackboard** of the prior task — inheriting facts, plan/trajectory, conversation history, and routing — and derives a fresh `{condition, verify}` goal from the new message (the prior task's `GoalState`, if any, is not inherited). See [Mechanism](#mechanism) and [Routing Invariant](#routing-invariant-one-routing-decision-per-goal-task).
- **One routing decision per goal task.** Routing (domain, complexity, matched+user skills) is established exactly once at the top of `runGoalLoop`, before derivation, and inherited unchanged by derivation + every goal turn; no turn re-routes, and `resumeGoalLoop` reuses the persisted routing. See [Routing Invariant](#routing-invariant-one-routing-decision-per-goal-task).
- Each goal-loop turn is a **fresh `Executor.Run`** (via `RunConductor); the loop is a turn-of-Conductors, not one long-lived executor.
- A `met` verdict **requires non-empty evidence** with each entry having non-empty `type`/`ref`/`summary` (enforced in `declare_goal_status`); a bare "done" cannot terminate the loop.
- **The verifier is isolated from the active task and as capable as the executor.** When enabled (`goal_loop.verification: independent`, the default), the verifier pass that re-checks a claimed `"met"` runs **between two agent turns** inside the held single-flight on a **fresh blackboard** (not the goal loop's blackboard) **seeded with the met turn's work product**; it inherits none of the still-active task's incomplete state (partial plan, pending step outputs). It does **not** increment `TurnCount` and is **not** counted against `MaxTurns` (a rejected `"met"` costs the budget one agent turn + one verifier pass — the agent turn already counted), and it runs on the **same complexity-derived step budget as a working turn**, not a fixed cap. See [Independent Verification](#independent-verification).
- **Verification is mode-driven.** *How* "done" is checked is set per goal (`GoalState.VerificationMode`, chosen at derivation, editable at approval): `executable` (default) re-runs a runnable verify clause (`verifierToolFilter`); `re_derivation` delegates a fresh read-only run of the goal's process (`verifierReDerivationToolFilter`). Both modes are read-only — every mutating tool and every goal-control tool is excluded, so `declare_verification` is the verifier's only output channel. The mode takes effect only while the global gate is `independent`.
- **A `"met"` rejected by the verifier can never terminate the goal as met.** Only a *confirmed* claim (or `verification: off`, or the nil-verifier seam) terminates as `met`; a rejected/non-declaring claim synthesizes a `not_met` verdict, feeds the reason back into the next agent turn, and continues the loop without re-incrementing the turn counter.
- Anti-spin: a turn with **zero tool calls AND no verdict AND no turn error** halts as `blocked_idle`; a turn that returned an **error** is retried a bounded number of times (`goalTurnMaxErrorRetries`) and, if it keeps failing, halts leaving the goal `active` (non-terminal) as a **resumable failure** (`ExecutionStatusFailed` → `task_failed_resumable`), recording the cause on `GoalState.LastError` — never `blocked_idle`/`partial`. The error branch runs BEFORE the verdict / anti-spin / budget logic.
- **Pause is session-level, not goal-level.** A cooperative `PauseSession` persists the **task** as paused (mid-turn, at the next step boundary) but leaves the **goal** `active`; `ResumeSession` re-enters `resumeGoalLoop` under the same goal. The universal pause signal is installed fresh per request and cleared on exit, so a stale signal never affects a future request. See [Pause is Session-Level](#pause-is-session-level-universal-pause-signal).
- The loop holds the single-flight guard for its entire multi-turn run; `PauseSession` releases it by breaking out (mid-turn, at the next step boundary).
- Terminal goal states (`met`, `exhausted`, `cancelled`) are never re-entered; `Resume` guards on `IsTerminal()`.
- The `GoalState` is persisted best-effort; a persistence failure never propagates (degrades only resumability).
- A turn error is retried a bounded number of times and, once exhausted, surfaces as a resumable failure (see the anti-spin invariant) — it never aborts the goal terminally and never becomes `blocked_idle`.
- The budget is resolved at activation (turn 1), not at derivation.
- `propose_goal` and `declare_goal_status` are `system`-group tools — coordination primitives, not user-facing capabilities.
- **Goal mode is unavailable while the Model Profiles essential-tools narrowing is active** (`goalBlocked = ModelProfiles.Enabled && EssentialTools.Enabled`, the effective/resolved values; master-on with the variant off does NOT block). The narrowing applies only to the non-goal Conductor path and the E2S branch (both run after goal mode's early return), so it never narrows a goal run; if it were applied to a goal run it would hide the goal-loop tooling (`propose_goal`, `declare_goal_status`, `declare_verification`) and make the loop unrunnable — which is why goal mode is refused, before any side effect, while the narrowing is active. A goal send (explicit flag OR `/goal` prefix) and a paused-goal resume are rejected at the session API (`modelProfilesGoalBlocked` / `goalResumeBlockedByModelProfiles`), and the orchestrator independently returns `ErrGoalBlockedByModelProfiles` from `HandleMessage`'s goal branch and `resumeGoalLoop`. See [model-profiles.md](model-profiles.md#goal-mode-gate-goalblocked).
