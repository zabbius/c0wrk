# Orchestration

## Purpose

The orchestration domain coordinates the full lifecycle of a user request: classifying it, running a single ReAct loop (the Conductor) that owns the task end-to-end, and delegating subtasks to isolated subagents. The Conductor replaces the prior system-driven plan-execute-reflect pipeline with an agent-driven loop where planning, interaction, and reflection are tool calls, not pipeline phases.

## Key Files

- `core/orchestrator.go` — top-level Orchestrator (HandleMessage, Resume, `ResolveVisionOptions` — per-call markitdown vision params for the currently active model, consumed by the backend attachment flow)
- `core/orchestrator_handle.go` — HandleMessage body: router → Conductor launch, `prepareRequestContext` (task-context enrichment incl. the markitdown vision resolver, attached on HandleMessage and Resume; flows through to subagent delegations)
- `core/orchestrator_goal.go` — goal mode: deriveGoal, runGoalLoop, resumeGoalLoop, runGoalTurns, budgets, anti-spin (see [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md))
- `core/orchestrator_e2s.go` — E2S mode entry: runE2SLoop (context/launcher wiring, Σ persistence via `task_e2s_state`, resume checkpoints), hooks the `e2s_state` snapshots
- `core/e2s/` — the E2S loop itself: the turn loop (`loop.go`), the `e2s_step` meta-tool + semantic anti-spin fingerprint (`steptool.go`), the Σ merge operator (`merge.go`), prompt composition (`prompt.go`), domain types (`types.go`) (see [../e2s.md](../e2s.md))
- `core/conductor.go` — Conductor entry point: builds system prompt, tool set, launches `Executor.Run`
- `core/modelprofiles/tools_filter.go` — pure tool-set narrowing for the Model Profiles essential-tools variant (see [../model-profiles.md](../model-profiles.md))
- `core/tools/delegate.go` — `delegate` tool (subagent launch with DAG + async)
- `core/tools/declare_plan.go` — `declare_plan` tool (roadmap publish + approval gate)
- `core/tools/reflect.go` — `reflect` tool (invokes Reflector on trajectory)
- `core/tools/cancel_delegation.go` — `cancel_delegation` tool (async cancellation)
- `core/tools/delegation_registry.go` — Delegation Registry (active/completed delegations per Conductor run)
- `github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/agent/router/router.go` — request classification (Route)
- `core/router_adapter.go` — core adapter wrapping sp4rk router
- `github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/agent/executor.go` — ReAct loop (Conductor and subagents are both `Executor.Run` instances)
- `github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/agent/subagent.go` — `RunSubAgent` / `RunSubAgentsParallel` (isolated executor in goroutine)
- `github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/agent/reflector/reflector.go` — failure analysis (Reflect), invoked via the `reflect` tool
- `github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/orchestration/dag.go` — DAG data structure (used by `delegate` and `declare_plan`)
- `core/plan_serializer.go` — Plan ↔ Markdown serialization (used by `declare_plan`)

## Flow

```
HandleMessage(ctx, message, sessionID, opts)
│
├─ 0. Inject vector search hints (non-blocking, 2s timeout)
├─ 0a. Emit initial context_fill (0%)
│
├─ 1. Blackboard lifecycle:
│     ├─ opts.TaskID == "": create new BB via bbFactory
│     └─ opts.TaskID != "": restore BB from persistence
│
├─ 2. Load available tools from registry (filtered via ListFiltered
│     to exclude disabled tools in No Project mode)
│
├─ E2S MODE (checked BEFORE goal mode): when opts.E2S, dispatch to
│     runE2SLoop instead of the route→Conductor flow below. The run
│     maintains an externalized state Σ the model reads and patches each
│     turn via the e2s_step meta-tool (state_patch + action); every turn is
│     a fresh one-shot [system, user] request (bounded O(1) context), and
│     actions dispatch through ToolRegistry.Execute with every security
│     gate intact. opts.E2S + opts.Goal together are a wiring mistake,
│     rejected with ErrE2SGoalConflict. Step-limit exhaustion is a
│     resumable checkpoint (Σ persists in task_e2s_state; Resume re-enters
│     the loop with the accumulated Σ and a fresh turn budget).
│     See [../e2s.md](../e2s.md).
│
├─ GOAL MODE: when opts.Goal, dispatch to runGoalLoop instead of the
│     route→Conductor flow below. Goal mode runs on BOTH a fresh task
│     (opts.TaskID == "") and a continuation (opts.TaskID != ""); on a
│     continuation the prior task's blackboard is restored first.
│     The goal loop derives a {condition, verify} goal with user sign-off,
│     then iterates the Conductor turn-by-turn until the agent declares the
│     goal met (with evidence), the budget is exhausted, the agent goes idle
│     (anti-spin), or the task is paused (a session-level control). Each turn
│     is a fresh Executor.Run; the loop holds the single-flight guard for its
│     whole run. See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md).
│
├─ 3. ROUTE (or continuation fast-path):
│     ├─ Continuation fast-path: if opts.TaskID != "" AND the restored BB
│     │   has BOTH an existing plan AND a routing decision → reuse the
│     │   routing decision, reactivate skills, skip the router LLM call.
│     │   The plan gate prevents a plan-less continuation from mis-routing.
│     └─ Default: router.Route(ctx, routingMessage, tools, history, skills)
│         → When opts.UserSkills is non-empty, routingMessage is augmented
│           with skill descriptions via buildSkillAugmentedRoutingMessage.
│         → RoutingDecision { Domain, Complexity, MatchedSkills }
│         → Emit Routing event
│
├─ 3a. No Project: override routing.Domain from "code" to "general"
│
├─ 4. Activate matched skills:
│     → Merge router-matched skills with opts.UserSkills (deduplicated union)
│     → Set ActiveSkills in context
│     → Emit SkillsActivated event
│       (skills narrow the available toolset only — policy comes from
│        security.groups, ADR-024; there is no skill policy layer)
│
├─ 4a. Model Profiles essential-tools filter (Conductor path and E2S mode
│     — never in goal mode):
│     → When the Model Profiles master toggle AND essential_tools.enabled (both
│       from model_profiles.enabled + the active profile's values), narrow the
│       available tool set via modelprofiles.SelectTools (static union:
│       always-present + protected base + every MCP tool + turn-scoped
│       guarantees; no budget, no router matching, no events emitted).
│       No-op when the profile is off.
│     → Goal mode returns before this point and is never narrowed.
│
├─ 5. Build Conductor:
│     ├─ System prompt = orchestrator core + family overlay + verification
│     │   mandate + workspace + env + active skills (verbatim) +
│     │   Conductor tool guidance (delegate, declare_plan, execute_plan,
│     │   reflect, ask_user)
│     ├─ Tool set = file ops + search + system-group tools (ask_user, finish,
│     │   store_fact, search_facts, update_checklist, declare_step_complete,
│     │   read_step_output, semantic_search) + Conductor tools (delegate,
│     │   declare_plan, execute_plan, reflect, cancel_delegation)
│     │   (semantic_search — like the search tools ripgrep and glob — is
│     │   excluded in No-Project (CHAT) mode via NoProjectDisabledTools,
│     │   applied by ListFiltered)
│     ├─ ContextManager via contextFactory
│     └─ Delegation Registry injected into context
│
├─ 6. Launch Conductor = executor.Run(ctx, conductorTools, cm)
│     └─ The Conductor owns the task until it calls finish.
│        Planning, decomposition, interaction, reflection all happen
│        as tool calls inside this loop.
│
├─ 7. Persist task outcome on BB per typed status (persistTaskOutcome):
│     success → completed; paused → PauseTask (pause/resume checkpoint; resumable);
│     partial/cancelled → left in_progress (resumable);
│     failed/aborted → failed (resumable)
│
└─ 8. Return HandleResult (carries Status + Reflections).
      A recordConversationOutcome defer updates conversationHistory for EVERY
      terminal outcome (success, failure, cancel).
```

## Execution Surface

| Surface | When | Behaviour |
| ------- | ---- | --------- |
| Simple task | Conductor never calls `delegate` | One ReAct loop, no subagents. Replaces the former "normal" single-step mode without planner overhead. |
| Complex task | Conductor calls `delegate` with one or more tasks | Subagents run isolated ReAct loops; Conductor sees only summaries. Replaces the former "advanced" multi-step DAG mode. |
| Interactive skill | Conductor calls `ask_user` / `declare_plan` mid-loop | Skill instructions are executable because the tools are available inside the loop. No pipeline-level gate. |
| Goal mode | Any message with `opts.Goal` (fresh task or continuation) | `runGoalLoop` replaces the single route→Conductor pass: derives a {condition, verify} goal with user sign-off, then iterates the Conductor turn-by-turn (each a fresh `Executor.Run`) until the agent declares the goal met, the budget is exhausted, the agent goes idle, or the task is paused (session-level). See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md). |
| E2S mode | Any message with `opts.E2S` (per-message frontend toggle; gated fail-closed on `experimental.enabled` on both sides) | `runE2SLoop` replaces the route→Conductor flow entirely: its own loop on raw sp4rk primitives (no Executor, no Conductor, no router) where the model's only memory is the externalized state Σ it patches every turn via `e2s_step`; actions dispatch through the registry with every security gate intact; delegation reuses the same conductor launcher with an inert plan state. Mutually exclusive with goal mode. See [../e2s.md](../e2s.md). |

There is no `executionMode` toggle. The Conductor chooses its own granularity based on task complexity and its system-prompt guidance.

## Invariants

- Every FIRST user message passes through Route; continuation messages (opts.TaskID != "") with a restored plan AND routing decision take the continuation fast-path and skip the router.
- Routing always produces a valid domain from {"code", "research", "general", "mixed"}.
- Complexity is always in range [1, 5].
- Exactly one Conductor `Executor.Run` instance owns a given task from start to finish.
- **Goal mode is a turn-of-Conductors, not one long-lived executor.** When `opts.Goal`, `runGoalLoop` iterates: each turn launches a fresh `Executor.Run` via `RunConductor`, reusing the normal continuation-trajectory mechanism so dialogue context persists across the turn boundary. Goal mode runs on BOTH a fresh task (`opts.TaskID == ""`) and a continuation (`opts.TaskID != ""`); on a continuation the prior task's blackboard is restored and the agent derives a fresh goal against the inherited facts/history. Routing is decided once at the top of `runGoalLoop` (before derivation) and inherited unchanged by every turn; no turn re-routes. The loop holds the single-flight guard for its whole run; `PauseSession` releases it by stopping the in-flight conductor at the next step boundary (the task is persisted as paused; the goal stays `active`). See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md).
- **E2S mode owns its loop and never mixes with the Conductor.** When `opts.E2S`, `runE2SLoop` runs on raw sp4rk primitives — no `Executor`, no Conductor, no router — with the `e2s_step` meta-tool as the model's only protocol surface. `opts.E2S` + `opts.Goal` together are rejected with `ErrE2SGoalConflict` (the E2S branch is checked first, so a conflict can never be silently swallowed by the goal branch). Plan-workflow and goal-only tools are stripped from the E2S catalog; step-limit exhaustion maps to `ExecutionStatusPartial` (a resumable checkpoint, not a failure). See [../e2s.md](../e2s.md).
- The Conductor always has `ask_user`, `declare_plan`, `execute_plan`, `reflect`, `delegate`, `cancel_delegation`, `finish` available (they are `system`-group tools — bypass policy; ADR-024).
- `finish` with pending async delegations is rejected: the executor's finish guard (`Executor.SetFinishGuard`, set by the sp4rk Conductor) returns an error while async delegations are pending, and the executor injects a nudge and retries rather than accepting finish. Finish is accepted only once every pending delegation completes or is cancelled via `cancel_delegation` — there is no implicit join, nothing waits.
- `ExecutionResult.Status` is the typed success contract: success | partial | failed | aborted | cancelled | paused. Callers consult it instead of parsing Output.
- Blackboard is created once per first message and restored for continuations.
- Vector search hints are non-blocking (2s timeout, failure is acceptable).
- Skills are activated task-wide and rendered verbatim in the Conductor system prompt (no truncation).
- requestInFlight (atomic.Bool) enforces the "one active request per `*Orchestrator`" invariant: HandleMessage CompareAndSwap's it to true on entry and stores false on defer; a concurrent caller is refused with `ErrRequestInFlight`.
- conversationHistory is updated for every terminal outcome of HandleMessage and Resume.
- When the assistant output contains tool-call syntax printed as text (failure-mode detected by `agent.DetectToolCallSyntaxInContent`), the history records a `HistoryNoteFailed(...)` note instead of the hallucinated text.
- isNoProject: routing domain "code" is overridden to "general" after classification.
- SetNoProjectMode(): disables code tools and adds extended bash command blacklist on the core tool registry.
- Model Profiles essential-tools filter: when active it runs exactly once per task on the Conductor path (before the ReAct loop) and inside the E2S branch (`runE2SWithState`), but never in goal mode; `finish` and the fact-memory / human-interaction tools always survive. The profile is strictly additive — every variant is inert when its master/sub-toggle is off. See [../model-profiles.md](../model-profiles.md).

## Configuration

From `config.yaml` (via BuilderConfig → OrchestratorConfig):

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `orchestration.maxDependencyContextChars` | 8000 | Max chars from dependency outputs injected into a delegation task |
| `orchestration.maxRedelegationDepth` | 2 | Maximum recursive delegation depth when `allow_redelegate` is true (ASI07-R6). 0 = use default (2) |
| `executor.compaction.sliding_window.keep_first` | 3 | Protected head messages during sliding-window compaction |
| `executor.compaction.sliding_window.keep_last` | 10 | Protected tail messages during sliding-window compaction |
| `executor.compaction.thresholds.pre_warning_percent` | 75 | Context-fill % that triggers the pre-compaction store_fact nudge |
| `security.agents_md_max_bytes` | 65536 | Cap on AGENTS.md content injected into prompts (0 = default; -1 = unlimited). Applies to the combined content of all AGENTS.md sources. |

The model profiles (`model_profiles.*` — knob values resolved from the active catalog profile) tune the Conductor for local / mid-size models (tool-set narrowing, system-prompt Lite swap, sampling override, loop hardening, context management). The feature is strictly additive and defaults to off. See [../model-profiles.md](../model-profiles.md).

Not wired from `config.yaml` (hardcoded defaults in code):
- `OrchestratorConfig.ConductorHistoryWindow` — default 20 (set in `NewOrchestrator`; not exposed as a config key).
- `OrchestratorConfig.AgentsMDSearchPaths` — resolved by the backend (`backend/configadapter.go`) from the user home directory. AGENTS.md is read from multiple sources and concatenated in priority order: (1) `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` (global, shared across all agents), (2) `~/.c0wrk/.agents/AGENTS.md` (c0wrk-specific), (3) `<workspace>/AGENTS.md` (project-specific). Missing files are silently skipped. The combined content is capped by `security.agents_md_max_bytes`. This applies in both CHAT (No Project) and CODE modes — in CHAT mode only the global and c0wrk files are read (no workspace).

Note: yaml key casing is mixed within and across config sections (see the struct tags in `backend/config/config.go`). `orchestration.*` uses `camelCase` (`maxDependencyContextChars`). `executor.compaction.sliding_window.*` uses `snake_case` (`keep_first`/`keep_last`), while sibling `executor.*` subsections use `camelCase` (`toolOutputPruning`, `historyMutation`, `circuitBreaker`). There is no top-level `conductor:` config section — `ConductorHistoryWindow` is not user-tunable via config (`MaxRedelegationDepth` is exposed as `orchestration.maxRedelegationDepth`).

## Extension Points

- Custom `ContextManagerFactory` for alternative memory strategies.
- Custom `BlackboardFactory` for alternative persistence.
- Custom `HITLHandler` for step limit and circuit breaker handling (applies to both Conductor and subagents).
- System prompt customization via the Conductor prompt builder.
- New Conductor tools: implement `tools.Tool`, register in `core/tools/builtin_registration.go`, add to the Conductor tool set in `core/conductor.go`. See [../../contracts/conductor-tools.md](../../contracts/conductor-tools.md).
