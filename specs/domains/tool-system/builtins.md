# Built-in Tools

## Role

c0wrk registers sp4rk's built-in tools plus the c0wrk-specific `ask_user` tool at startup via `RegisterBuiltinTools`. This spec documents c0wrk's tool catalog, registration order, and configuration. The tool implementations (filesystem, search, web, agent-infrastructure), file-safety judging, and file-coherence checking are **sp4rk engine** behavior — see [the sp4rk builtins spec](https://github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/blob/main/specs/domains/tool-system/builtins.md).

## Key Files

- `core/tools/builtin_registration.go` — `RegisterBuiltinTools(registry, cfg)` + `BuiltinToolsConfig`; passes the config `ShellBlocklist` to the platform-specific `newShellExecTool`
- `core/tools/shelltool_unix.go` / `core/tools/shelltool_windows.go` — build-tag split for the shell-exec tool constructor (`builtins.NewBashExecToolWithInvocation` on Unix, `builtins.NewPoshExecToolWithInvocation` on Windows); sp4rk's `bash.go`/`posh.go` are mutually exclusive per OS
- `core/tools/read_file_doc.go` — c0wrk `ReadFileDocTool` wrapper over sp4rk `ReadFileTool` that converts document formats (pdf, docx, pptx, xlsx, odt, html, htm) to markdown via `core/markitdown`; implements sp4rk's `ContentBackedReader` so converted results are content-backed cached
- `core/tools/askuser.go` / `core/tools/askuser_types.go` — c0wrk-specific `ask_user` tool + AskUser request/response types (moved out of sp4rk per ADR-011)
- `core/toolmanager/` — manages external binaries (`rg`, `uv`, `markitdown`), auto-downloaded on first run to `~/.c0wrk/tools/bin/`, PATH-prepended at startup (ADR-010)

Engine files (`github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/tools/builtins/*.go`, including `file_reader.go`, `ripgrep.go`, `tool_result_read.go`, `web_search/`, `batch.go`, `checklist.go`, `coherence.go`) are documented in [the sp4rk builtins spec](https://github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/blob/main/specs/domains/tool-system/builtins.md).

## Tool Catalog

c0wrk's registered tools, their capability group (ADR-024 — drives policy and tool budgets; default policies: read-only groups `allow`, mutating groups `user_confirm`, `system` unconfigurable), and trust classification:

| Tool                  | Category  | Group          | Untrusted | Description                                        |

| `read_file`           | File      | `local_read` | yes       | Read file contents (streaming, O(1) memory, default 2000-line window); document formats (pdf, docx, pptx, xlsx, odt, html, htm) auto-converted to markdown via markitdown |
| `write_file`          | File      | `local_write` | no        | Create/overwrite file                              |

| `web_search`          | Web       | `remote_read` | yes       | Search the web (optional, needs API key)           |
| `finish`              | Agent     | `system` | no        | Signal task/step completion                        |
| `ask_user`            | Agent     | `system` | no        | Prompt user for information (c0wrk-specific, `core/tools/askuser.go`) |
| `propose_goal`        | Agent     | `system` | no        | Goal-mode derivation: submit a {condition, verify} goal proposal for user sign-off. Blocks until the user approves (optionally with edits) or cancels. A no-op outside a derivation Conductor run (no `GoalProposer` in context). See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md). |
| `declare_goal_status` | Agent     | `system` | no        | Goal-mode self-evaluation: write a structured {status, evidence, reason} verdict into the context-injected `GoalStatusSink`. Status `"met"` **requires non-empty evidence** (each entry must have non-empty `type`/`ref`/`summary`). A no-op outside a goal-loop turn (no sink in context). See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md). |
| `declare_verification` | Agent   | `system` | no        | Goal-mode verification: write the independent verifier's structured {confirmed, reason, evidence} verdict into the context-injected `VerificationSink`. `confirmed: true` **requires non-empty evidence**. A no-op outside a verification turn (no sink in context). See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md). |
| `list_step_outputs`   | Agent     | `system` | no        | List completed step results                        |
| `read_step_output`    | Agent     | `system` | no        | Read specific step output                          |
| `read_final_result`   | Agent     | `system` | no        | Read the prior task's final result from the blackboard |
| `update_checklist`    | Agent     | `system` | no        | Update checklist for current step or standalone. A context `ChecklistGuard` rejects **starting** a standalone (empty step_id) checklist once a plan is active in the run, but keeps accepting one already begun earlier in the run. |
| `declare_step_complete` | Agent   | `system` | no        | Signal inline plan step completion (emits `plan_step_complete`) |
| `store_fact`          | Agent     | `system` | no        | Store fact to blackboard                           |
| `search_facts`        | Agent     | `system` | no        | Search blackboard facts                            |
| `read_attachment`     | Agent     | `system` | yes       | Read the markdown content of a user-attached file by ID (from the context-injected `AttachmentStore`) |
| `batch`               | Agent     | `system` | no        | Execute multiple tool calls sequentially in one turn (intercepted at executor level) |
| `read_skill_resource` | Agent     | `system` | no        | Read skill resource files                          |
| `tool_result_read`    | Agent     | `system` | yes       | Read cached tool result fragments by hash          |
| `delegate`            | Agent     | `system` | yes       | Launch a subagent for a delegated task (`core/tools/delegate.go`) |
| `cancel_delegation`   | Agent     | `system` | no        | Cancel a running delegation (`core/tools/cancel_delegation.go`) |
| `reflect`             | Agent     | `system` | no        | Trigger a reflection pass over the task (`core/tools/reflect.go`) |
| `declare_plan`        | Agent     | `system` | no        | Publish a plan for user sign-off (`core/tools/declare_plan.go`) |
| `execute_plan`        | Agent     | `system` | no        | Execute a declared plan inline (`core/tools/execute_plan.go`) |

These agent-infrastructure tools are tagged `ToolGroup: sdktools.GroupSystem` on their constructors — the **reserved `system` group** bypasses policy/judge checks during execution (membership is declared on the tool, not an out-of-band name set; the group cannot appear in `security.groups`). `batch` is additionally intercepted at the executor level before reaching the registry.

Three system-group tools are **goal-mode-only** (`goalModeTools`, gated by `IsGoalModeTool`/`StripGoalModeTools`): `propose_goal`, `declare_goal_status`, and `declare_verification`. They are offered to the agent **only** when the session is running a goal loop — a non-goal Conductor run strips them from the available-tool list so the agent never sees goal-specific tools when goal mode is off. The goal loop and the independent verifier receive the unstripped list. See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md).

### Shell-Execution Tool (`bash_exec` / `posh_exec`)

The shell-execution tool is platform-specific: sp4rk's `bash.go` is `//go:build !windows` and `posh.go` is `//go:build windows`, and they are mutually exclusive per OS. A single unconditional constructor call would fail to compile on the other OS, so the registration path is split behind build tags:

- `core/tools/shelltool_unix.go` → `builtins.NewBashExecToolWithInvocation` → registers `bash_exec`
- `core/tools/shelltool_windows.go` → `builtins.NewPoshExecToolWithInvocation` → registers `posh_exec`

Both expose the same constructor signature `newShellExecTool(blocklist, timeouts, bashInvocation, poshInvocation)`; the caller (`RegisterBuiltinTools`) passes the config `ShellBlocklist` plus the optional `shell_exec` launch-shape override (see [Shell Invocation Override](#shell-invocation-override-shell_exec)) to the platform-specific constructor — the Unix file consumes the bash entry, the Windows file the posh entry, a nil pointer keeps the built-in default. The registered name differs per platform, so all name-keyed configuration and policy lookups resolve through `core.activeShellToolName()` (`bash_exec` on Unix, `posh_exec` on Windows) — see [Blocklist / Policy Key](#blocklist--policy-key) below and [../../architecture/security-model.md](../../architecture/security-model.md).

Prompt data references the shell tool through the `{shell_tool}` placeholder rather than a hardcoded name, so tool-priority guidance always points at the tool actually registered on the current platform. The placeholder is resolved by `prompts.SubstituteShellTool` at each prompt-assembly call site (`core/systemprompt.go`); the embedded prompt vars are kept as raw templates (placeholder recoverable).

#### Blocklist / Policy Key

The shell blocklist and policy are read from the **`execute` group** (`security.groups.execute`) — a single platform-agnostic entry covering both `bash_exec` and `posh_exec`. In `core/builder.go` → `configToBuiltinToolsConfig`, the blocklist is sourced from `cfg.Security.Groups["execute"].Blocklist`; in `applySecurityPolicies` the group policies are applied to the shared registry (`ApplySecurityState`) and to every live per-session clone (`ApplyGroupPolicies`, which carries group policies + auto-approval only — the per-task autonomy posture is re-synced at task launch, ADR-053). The blocklist is **empty by default — c0wrk ships no predefined patterns** (ADR-052): it is the user's personal extension on top of the deterministic flowsh criteria (e.g. a `sudo` or `shutdown` pattern for shapes the criteria deliberately leave to judgment). A load-time migration moves a legacy custom `blacklist:` list into `blocklist:`; lists equal to the old shipped default are dropped (effective empty). The former Windows-only `Remove-Item`-alias platform supplement is deleted — its engine-floor rationale (cross-dialect safety of a *shipped default*) died with the shipped defaults, and the flowsh criteria are dialect-aware by construction (bash and PowerShell grammars each get their own analyzer dialect).

#### Shell Invocation Override (`shell_exec`)

The `shell_exec` config section lets the operator override HOW the platform shell tool launches the agent's command and declare WHICH shell the command text is written in ([ADR-058](../../decisions/058-shell-execution-override.md)). Per tool (`shell_exec.bash_exec` — live on Unix, `shell_exec.posh_exec` — live on Windows):

- `command` is an argv template (first element = binary, exactly one element = the `{command}` placeholder, replaced by the agent's command as a single argv element); empty = built-in `bash -c` / `powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -Command` shape.
- `shell` is a closed enum — `bash|sh|zsh|ksh|dash` (bash family) and `powershell|pwsh` (PowerShell family) — seeded with the tool's native kind when omitted; an omitted kind is silent, an invalid entry is fail-soft (load warning in `config.normalizeShellExec` + section reset to the default shape).

The declared kind reaches the engine as `sdktools.ShellInvocation` (`backend/configadapter.go` → `BuilderConfig.ShellExec` → `BuiltinToolsConfig` → `newShellExecTool`) and drives three things: the composed tool description (an override rewrites only the "Purpose:" header with the real launch command + declared shell — the description is the prompt channel that reaches every agent able to call the tool; the default invocation keeps the legacy description byte-for-byte), the flowsh analysis dialect (the registry's `AttachShellAnalysisForTool` resolves it via `sdktools.ShellAnalysisLangForTool` from the tool's `DeclaredShellKind()`), and the PowerShell-only UTF-8 bootstrap. Runtime edits (Settings → Security → Shell execution card, `GetShellExecSettings`/`UpdateShellExecSettings`) re-register the tool through the same atomic `UpdateShellBlocklist` path as blocklist edits, with rollback on failure. Security gates are unaffected: policy, blocklist, flowsh criteria, confirmations, and verify-on-edit's unattended canonical gate all behave identically — the override changes how a command is launched, never what is checked.

## Registration Order

```go
RegisterBuiltinTools(registry, cfg):
  1. shell-exec tool — `bash_exec` on Unix, `posh_exec` on Windows (with the user blocklist + timeouts; constructor call split by build tag in `core/tools/shelltool_{unix,windows}.go`)
  2. File tools (read, write, edit, list, mkdir, rmdir, rm)
     — read_file is registered as `NewReadFileDocTool`, a wrapper over sp4rk `ReadFileTool` that transparently converts document formats to markdown (plain-text files delegate to the inner tool unchanged)
  3. finish
  4. web_fetch
  5. web_search (optional: needs search provider config)
  6. glob, ripgrep
  7. tool_result_read
  8. batch
  9. read_step_output, list_step_outputs, read_final_result
  10. update_checklist, declare_step_complete
  11. store_fact, search_facts
  12. read_attachment (reads user-attached files via the context-injected `AttachmentStore`; attachment IDs are surfaced by `Orchestrator.augmentWithAttachments`)
  13. semantic_search (optional: needs vector search func)
  14. ask_user (optional: needs ask_user func)
  15. delegate, cancel_delegation, reflect — delegation/reflection coordination primitives (always registered; no-ops without a `DelegationRegistry`/`ReflectionRunner`)
  16. declare_plan — plan declaration coordination primitive (always registered; `declare_plan`'s `await_approval` mode needs a `PlanApprovalFunc`)
  17. propose_goal — goal-mode derivation coordination primitive (always registered; a no-op outside a derivation Conductor run)
  18. declare_goal_status — goal-mode self-evaluation verdict writer (always registered; a no-op outside a goal-loop turn; `met` requires non-empty evidence)
  19. declare_verification — goal-mode independent-verifier verdict writer (always registered; a no-op outside a verification turn; `confirmed` requires non-empty evidence)
  20. execute_plan — plan execution coordination primitive (always registered; reads the declared plan from the blackboard via a context-injected `PlanStepExecutor`; no-op outside a Conductor run)
```

Note: `read_skill_resource` is registered separately in `NewOrchestratorBuilder` (not in `RegisterBuiltinTools`).

## `ask_user` (c0wrk-specific)

The `ask_user` tool and its UI types (`AskUserFunc`, `AskUserRequest`, `AskUserResponse`, `AskUserQuestion`, `AskUserAnswer`, `AskUserOption`) live in `core/tools/` — they were moved out of sp4rk per ADR-011 because they are host-application UI concerns. The tool is registered only when an `ask_user` func is provided.

## Goal-Mode Tools (`propose_goal`, `declare_goal_status`, `declare_verification`)

Goal mode adds three system-group coordination tools (`ToolGroup: sdktools.GroupSystem` — they bypass policy and the tool judge because they are coordination primitives, not user-facing capabilities). They are safe to register unconditionally and are no-ops outside a goal-mode run (the context value they read is nil).

- **`propose_goal`** (`core/tools/propose_goal.go`) — used by the derivation agent to submit a {condition, verify, verification_mode} goal for user sign-off. It reads a `GoalProposer` from the context (`GoalProposerFrom`), which the orchestrator injects during `deriveGoal` (desktop supplies the implementation that emits a `goal_proposal` event and blocks for the user response). The approved (possibly user-edited) values are echoed back so the agent commits to the user's wording. A no-op (clear error) when no proposer is in context.
- **`declare_goal_status`** (`core/tools/declare_goal_status.go`) — the single channel through which the goal loop learns a structured verdict. It writes a typed `goal.Verdict` into the per-turn `GoalStatusSink` (`GoalStatusSinkFrom`), which `runGoalTurns` injects. **Declaring status `"met"` requires non-empty evidence** — enforced at the tool boundary so a bare "done" can never terminate the loop without a concrete, inspectable artifact. The tool executor does not validate inputs against the JSON schema, so the check rejects both an absent array and a present-but-empty entry (`evidence:[{}]`, `evidence:[{"ref":""}]`): each entry must have non-empty `type`, `ref`, and `summary`. A no-op (clear error) when no sink is in context.
- **`declare_verification`** (`core/tools/declare_verification.go`) — the single channel through which the independent verifier reports its structured outcome. It writes a `VerificationOutcome` (`Confirmed`, `Reason`, `Evidence`) into the per-turn `VerificationSink`, which the verification pass injects. **Declaring `confirmed: true` requires non-empty evidence**, mirroring `declare_goal_status`'s guard. A no-op (clear error) when no sink is in context. Offered only to the independent verifier, not the main agent (`verifierToolFilter`/`verifierReDerivationToolFilter` build the verifier's group-based toolset — see [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md)).

All three follow the same context-injection pattern as `declare_plan`/`ask_user`: the orchestrator injects the dependency via a context value before the relevant Conductor run; the tool reads it back at execution time. See [../goal-mode.md](../goal-mode.md) for the full goal-mode lifecycle.

## Tool-Manager Wiring (`rg`)

`ripgrep` invokes the `rg` binary via `exec.CommandContext` and parses the `rg --json` event stream (exit code 1 = "no matches", not an error; ≥ 2 = `IsError`). The `rg` binary is a managed runtime dependency provided by `core/toolmanager/` — downloaded on first run to `~/.c0wrk/tools/bin/` and PATH-prepended at startup (ADR-010).

## Ignore Filtering (`glob` / `ripgrep`)

Discovery tools honour the project's ignore files via an `ignore.IgnoreChecker` attached to the task context. The session manager builds a **multi-root resolver** over the symlink-resolved, deduplicated workspace path **plus** the session's auxiliary work directories (`backend/session/manager_execution.go` → `injectIgnoreChecker` → `tools.WithIgnoreChecker`) once per task; `glob` and `ripgrep` read it back through `tools.IgnoreCheckerFrom` and filter per the containing root's own `.gitignore` + `.aiignore`.

- `glob` honours `.gitignore` **and** nested `.aiignore` files fully (resolver-based).
- `ripgrep` honours `.gitignore` natively; the root-level `.aiignore` at the search root is passed to `rg` via `--ignore-file`. Nested `.aiignore` is **not** honoured by `rg` — a documented, accepted limitation.
- When no checker is plumbed through the context (e.g., No Project with no workspace and no work directories), the tools keep their unfiltered behaviour.
- `read_file` deliberately does **not** consult the checker: ignore filtering governs *discovery*, not *access*.

See [ADR-016](../../decisions/016-aiignore.md) for the rationale and the engine primitive (`github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/ignore`).

## Document Conversion (`read_file` wrapper)

`read_file` is registered as `NewReadFileDocTool` (`core/tools/read_file_doc.go`), a wrapper that embeds sp4rk's `ReadFileTool`. Plain-text files delegate to the inner streaming reader unchanged. Document formats — pdf, docx, pptx, xlsx, odt, html, htm — are converted to markdown via `core/markitdown` (the managed markitdown CLI, ADR-010; the same converter used by the attachment flow in [../session-lifecycle.md](../session-lifecycle.md)).

**Vision assistance** — when the managed venv is installed and the model active at the moment of the read is vision-capable, the conversion runs through the markitdown Python API (embedded driver) instead of the CLI, so images embedded in the document are captioned by that model. The vision parameters are resolved PER DOCUMENT from a resolver the Orchestrator attaches to the task context — a mid-task model switch applies to the next read. Any failure degrades to the plain CLI path. **Note the egress implication**: embedded document images are sent to the active LLM provider's endpoint (see [Vision-assisted Document Conversion — Data Egress](../session-lifecycle.md#vision-assisted-document-conversion--data-egress)); there is no separate config toggle.

**Caching** — the wrapper implements sp4rk's optional `ContentBackedReader` interface (`IsContentBacked` returns true only for document extensions). The executor therefore stores converted results in memory (content-backed, paginatable via `tool_result_read`) instead of treating the file on disk as the backing store. Converted markdown is additionally persisted under `<session-temp>/conversions/<sha256(path+mtime+size+vision-identity)>.md`, so paginated reads and re-reads don't re-run the subprocess; the key changes when the source file is modified **or when the vision configuration differs** (a document converted without captions is never served from cache after switching to a vision-capable model, and vice versa). Writes are atomic (temp file + rename) so concurrent readers never observe a half-written entry.

**Fallback** — on conversion failure, or when markitdown is unavailable, the wrapper falls back to the inner streaming reader with a warning prepended (`[Warning: document conversion failed …; showing raw file content.]`).

**Limits** — the same `DefaultFileLimits()` caps (`MaxLineBytes`, `MaxWindowLines`) apply to converted output, and the requested line range is validated up front to prevent inverted-range panics. The converter is lazily initialized on first document read (2-minute per-file timeout; a vision-assisted attempt shares one elevated ≥5-minute budget with its plain fallback).

## Limits Configuration

Per-tool output truncation is centralized in the executor's two-stage pipeline (see [../orchestration/executor.md](../orchestration/executor.md)). No individual tool performs per-tool output truncation; all truncation happens in Stage 1 → Stage 2 after the full result is cached.

**`read_file` is special**: for plain-text files it uses a streaming line-range reader (sp4rk `ReadFileRange`) that reads only the requested window from disk — O(1) memory. The file on disk serves as the cache backing store (file-backed cache entry), so `ToolResultCache` stores zero bytes of content for plain-text `read_file` results. Document formats are the exception — converted markdown is content-backed cached (see [Document Conversion](#document-conversion-read_file-wrapper) below).

| Config                              | Affects                    | Default            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `toolLimits.readDefaultLines`       | `read_file` window size    | 2000               |
| `toolLimits.perToolTruncation`      | All cacheable tools (map)  | per-tool           |
| `executor.tool_result_budget.cacheTTLSeconds` | ToolResultCache eviction   | 300                |

Default per-tool Stage 1 truncation: `read_file` 2000 lines, `read_attachment` 2000 lines, `ripgrep` 2000, `glob` 2000, `list_directory` 2000, the shell-exec tool (`bash_exec`/`posh_exec`) 5000, `web_fetch` 2097152 bytes (2 MiB).

`read_file` internal safety caps (hardcoded in `DefaultFileLimits()`, not configurable): `MaxLineBytes` 1 MiB (per-line), `MaxWindowLines` 50000 (hard cap per call).

Non-truncation tool limits:

| Config                       | Affects                   | Default             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `BashTimeouts.MaxTimeout`    | shell-exec (`bash_exec`/`posh_exec`) | 120s                |
| `BashTimeouts.WaitDelay`     | shell-exec (`bash_exec`/`posh_exec`) | 5s                  |
| `ShellBlocklist`             | shell-exec (`bash_exec`/`posh_exec`) | [] (user-authored regex patterns, empty by default — ADR-052) |
| `WebSearchLimits.MaxResults` | web_search                | 5                   |

## Engine Behavior (canonical in sp4rk)

The following are sp4rk engine primitives, documented in [the sp4rk builtins spec](https://github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/blob/main/specs/domains/tool-system/builtins.md) — do not duplicate here:

- Tool implementations (file_reader streaming, ripgrep `--json` parsing, web_search provider abstraction, batch interception, checklist validation)
- File-safety judging (`judgeReadInSessionRoots` / `judgeWriteInSessionRoots`, the 11 `ToolJudger` implementations) — c0wrk's session-root/auto-approval layer on top is in [../../architecture/security-model.md](../../architecture/security-model.md)
- File-coherence checking (`FileCoherenceChecker`, cross-session conflict detection) — wired into context by the c0wrk session manager
- `tool_result_read` fragment reading (file-backed + content-backed entries, coherence validation)

## Adding a New Built-in Tool — Checklist

1. Create the tool file: sp4rk builtins go in `github.com/v0lka/sp4rk/tools/builtins/<name>.go`; c0wrk-specific tools (like `ask_user`) go in `core/tools/`
2. Implement the sp4rk `Tool` interface; add constructor `NewXxxTool(...)` with relevant limits/config
3. Register in `core/tools/builtin_registration.go` → `RegisterBuiltinTools()`
4. If the tool needs config, add a field to `BuiltinToolsConfig`
5. If config comes from `config.yaml`, update `core/builder.go` → `configToBuiltinToolsConfig()`
6. If the tool reads data from external sources (filesystem, web, subprocess), set `Untrusted: true` on `BaseTool` so output is wrapped before entering the LLM context
7. Declare the tool's **capability group** — set `ToolGroup` on `BaseTool` (sp4rk builtins: pick from `tools/group.go`; c0wrk orchestration/infra tools: `sdktools.GroupSystem`, which requires security review). The group drives the tool's policy (`security.groups`), subagent budgets, and verifier sets; an undeclared group fails closed everywhere (ADR-024)
8. If the tool is mutating (writes files, runs commands), it belongs to a mutating group (`local_write`, `execute`, `local_mcp`, `remote_mcp`, `remote_write`) whose default policy is `user_confirm`
