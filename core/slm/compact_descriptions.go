// compactDescriptions maps builtin tool names to one-line descriptions used
// when the active profile's essential_tools.compact_descriptions knob is
// enabled. Full rubric descriptions (purpose/when-to-use/inputs/outputs/
// example/anti-example, 480-1100 chars) are ideal for large models but cost
// real prompt budget on small local ones; these one-liners keep the
// disambiguation (the "vs neighbor" hint) while dropping the long form.
// Unknown tools (e.g. MCP) keep their original description.
