// Package goal defines the Goal domain: the user's declared success condition,
// the budget that constrains how much work the agent may spend reaching it, and
// the runtime state machine that tracks progress toward (or away from) that
// condition.
//
// A Goal is the persistent answer to "are we done yet?". The orchestrator
// consults GoalState after each turn to decide whether to continue, pause, or
// stop. The Verdict captures the most recent machine- or user-declared outcome
// of attempting to verify the condition, along with the evidence backing it.
//
// Zero-values are meaningful throughout this package:
//   - A GoalBudget with MaxTurns == 0 means "unlimited" — the goal imposes no
//     turn cap.
//   - A nil LastVerdict means no verification has been performed yet.

//	exhausted     — the budget was consumed without meeting the condition
//	                 (terminal failure: turns/tokens/deadline hit).
