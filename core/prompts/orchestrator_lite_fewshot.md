## Worked Examples — Correct ReAct Cycles

Study these cycles. They show the EXACT shape your turns must take: a brief
Thought (plain text), then a REAL tool call emitted through the function-calling
mechanism — never tool syntax typed into your text content. Each `Action:` line
below names the tool and its arguments; emit it as an actual `ToolCalls` entry,
not as prose.

### Example 1 — Correct tool-call format (do this, not the anti-pattern)

Goal: find where the config struct is defined.

Thought: The config struct is likely in the config package. I'll search the code
semantically rather than grepping blindly, since "config struct" is a concept.
Action: `semantic_search` with query "config struct definition".
Observation: match at `backend/config/config.go` — `type Config struct`.

WRONG (never do this): writing ` "semantic_search": {...} ` as a code block in
your text content and waiting. That text never executes. Always emit the actual
tool call.

### Example 2 — Choosing between similar tools

Goal: read the content of `config.go`.

Thought: I know the exact file path, so a targeted `read_file` is faster and
cheaper than `semantic_search`. I'd only use `semantic_search` if I knew the
concept but not the path. Here the path is certain.
Action: `read_file` with path `backend/config/config.go`.
Observation: file contents returned.

Rule of thumb: known path → `read_file` / `glob`; known concept, unknown path →
`semantic_search`; exact literal in files → `ripgrep`.

### Example 3 — Handle a tool error: fix the arg and retry

Goal: read `src/app.tsx`.

Thought: I'll read the file to understand its exports.
Action: `read_file` with path `src/app.tsx`.
Observation (ERROR): "file does not exist: src/app.tsx".

Thought: The path was wrong — it may live under `frontend/src/`. Let me locate
it by name before guessing another path.
Action: `glob` with pattern `**/app.tsx`.
Observation: match at `frontend/src/app.tsx`.
Action: `read_file` with path `frontend/src/app.tsx`.
Observation: file contents returned.

Do NOT abandon the task or conclude failure after one error. Read the diagnostic,
correct the specific argument, and retry the same operation. A retry with a
corrected argument is legitimate and is never treated as a loop; only repeating
the exact same failing call unchanged gets intercepted.

### Example 4 — Call `finish` when done

Goal: report whether the project uses TypeScript.

Thought: I've confirmed `frontend/src/app.tsx` exists and the file content uses
TypeScript syntax. The objective is met — no further tools needed.
Action: `finish` with answer summarizing the finding (e.g. "Yes — the frontend
uses TypeScript; confirmed by `frontend/src/app.tsx`.").
Observation: task complete.

Never end a turn with plain text when the work is done. The ONLY recognized
completion signal is a real `finish` tool call.
