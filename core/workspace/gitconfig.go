// This file implements a safe, exec-free reader for a repository's .git/config
// (see the GitSpawn vulnerability class: a repo that arrives as files with its
// .git directory intact can carry command-bearing config keys that git executes
// on ordinary operations — status/diff/add/commit/merge — without any user
// interaction, because `git clone` deliberately does not transfer config but
// archive/USB/shared-drive distribution does).
//
// Scope (per the GitSpawn remediation plan): the INI subset under the
// command-relevant section families — core, attr, extensions (model-only:
// objectformat/worktreeConfig), filter.<name>, merge.<name>, diff.<name>.
// include/includeIf directives are parsed, logged and recorded but
// deliberately NOT followed by the key scanner: the included files' contents
// are unknown, so a config with includes must be treated as partially
// invisible. (ResolveIncludes is the one exception — it follows the directives
// for trust fingerprinting only, never for key neutralization; see its doc.)
// NeutralizingOverrides compensates on three fronts: per-name -c pins for
// every command-bearing driver key visible in the scanned config (a pinned
// driver is a fixed benign command no matter which routing source — the
// in-tree .gitattributes included — routes paths to it); core.attributesFile=
// (empty) for that routing source, plus the attribute-routing FILES git
// reads without any kill-switch — .git/info/attributes and the
// core.attributesFile target — which are themselves scanned and every routed
// driver name they contain is pinned the same way (-c overrides beat file
// config no matter where, including an included file, the driver is
// defined); and attr.tree (object-format aware) as the narrow fallback for
// the one case per-name pins cannot cover — include directives that may
// hide driver definitions whose names the scan never sees. An attribute
// source that exists but cannot be scanned makes the whole scan fail closed
// (see review-post-v0.7.3 finding [1]); the attr.tree fallback's collateral
// (benign eol/text attributes disabled) is documented with finding [56].
//
// Linked worktrees are scanned with merge semantics ([2] of the same
// review): the worktree gitdir's commondir file resolves the common dir,
// whose config — plus the optional config.worktree overlay when
// extensions.worktreeConfig is enabled — is exactly what git reads there.
//
// The network-transport keys the Git panel's remote RPCs (pull/push/fetch)
// reach — core.sshCommand, core.askPass, core.gitProxy, credential.helper
// and credential.<url>.helper — and the external diff drivers
// (diff.external, diff.<n>.command), which plain `git diff` executes by
// default, are in scope as well with per-key neutralizations
// (post-v0.7.3 review findings [40]/[55]; every value canary-verified on
// git 2.50.1). core.gitProxy has no neutralizable value of its own (empty
// included) and is killed through the transport family instead
// (-c protocol.git.allow=never); core.worktree redirects tracked-file
// writes outside the workspace and no -c form beats it, so it is
// neutralized by the GIT_WORK_TREE env pin GitCmdInRepo applies when the
// finding is present (the one channel that outranks the config key). The
// only command-bearing core key left without any override is core.pager:
// c0wrk always pipes git output and a pager only runs on a terminal.
// Include-bearing configs additionally derive name-independent pins
// (core.sshCommand=ssh, core.askPass=, credential.helper=, diff.external=)
// for the keys an included file may set invisibly, and GitCmdInRepo fails
// closed for them on git older than 2.45, where attr.tree — the only cover
// for include-hidden attribute-routed drivers — is silently ignored.
//
// Out of scope, with rationale: commit.gpgsign / gpg.program (signing vectors)
// are neutralized unconditionally by the sysproc.GitCmd baseline
// (-c commit.gpgsign=false + GIT_EDITOR=true, see step_2 of the remediation),
// so per-repo detection adds nothing actionable for c0wrk's local operation
// set. Findings for baseline-covered keys are still reported (fsmonitor,
// hooksPath, editor) with BaselineCovered=true so the intake scanner shows the
// full picture from this single source.
//
// Neutralization values are not invented here — every emitted override comes
// from the canary-verified semantics of the GitSpawn neutralization study
// (git 2.50.1): attr.tree=<empty tree> kills ALL attribute-routed vectors;
// filter.<n>.process= (empty) plus clean=cat/smudge=cat disarms a named filter
// (process= alone would fall back to attacker-supplied clean/smudge);
// merge.<n>.driver="false %O %A %B" resolves conflicts without executing the
// attacker driver; diff.<n>.textconv=cat renders diffs as passthrough.
//
// Guarantees of the parser: it never spawns a process, never follows symlinks
// beyond opening the single config file, caps the input size, never panics on
// malformed input, and over-reports rather than under-reports on constructs it
// is lenient about (git itself refuses malformed configs wholesale, so a
// construct we mis-read is one git would not execute either — and every
// malformed line is recorded in Errors so callers can fail closed).

// EmptyTreeSHA1 is the SHA-1 of the empty git tree. Forcing
// -c attr.tree=<EmptyTreeSHA1> makes git read .gitattributes from the empty
// tree instead of the worktree, which neutralizes every attribute-routed
// command vector (clean/smudge/process filters, merge drivers, textconv,
// external diff drivers). Verified: attr.tree="" (empty) is NOT safe, and

// NeutralizingOverrides derives the per-repo neutralizing `-c` set from the

//
//   - one filter.<n>.process= + filter.<n>.clean=cat + filter.<n>.smudge=cat
//     triple per armed filter name (process= alone would fall back to
//     attacker-supplied clean/smudge),
//
//   - merge.<n>.driver="false %O %A %B" per custom merge driver,
//
//   - diff.<n>.textconv=cat per armed textconv,
//
//   - attr.tree=<empty tree> ONLY when include directives were recorded
//     (post-v0.7.3 review [56]): a per-name pin neutralizes every KNOWN
//     driver wherever it is routed from — the in-tree .gitattributes source
//     included — so the blanket kill is not needed for visible keys, and it
//     disables benign attributes too (eol/text normalization), making CRLF
//     repositories report falsely-modified files and whole-file numstat
//     diffs (empirically confirmed on git 2.50.1 with a `* text=auto`
//     repository). Includes are the one case per-name pins cannot cover: an
//     included file may define a filter whose name the scan never sees,
//     routed from the in-tree .gitattributes — only attr.tree kills that
//     source (the info/attributes and core.attributesFile sources are
//     scanned and pinned instead). The empty-tree constant matches the
//     repository's object format (SHA-1 or SHA-256); on SHA-256 repositories
//     the SHA-1 hash is a silent no-op, so ScanGitConfig resolves
//     ObjectFormat (fail-closed) and this derivation selects EmptyTreeSHA256
//     accordingly.
//
//   - core.attributesFile= (empty) whenever the key is set or any include
//     directive was recorded: attr.tree does NOT cover this routing source,
//     and an empty value disables it (verified: git 2.50.1 respects
//     core.attributesFile from repository config, and the -c override beats
//     it no matter which file — including an included one — set it).
//
//   - for every filter/merge/diff routing discovered in .git/info/attributes
//     or the core.attributesFile file (sources attr.tree does not cover),
//     the same per-name neutralization as for visible config keys: the -c
//     overrides beat file config regardless of where the routed driver is
//     defined — including an included file the scanner cannot read.
//
//   - diff.external= (empty) per configured default external diff command:
//     plain `git diff` executes it BY DEFAULT — --ext-diff is NOT required
//     and --no-ext-diff is what disables it (verified on git 2.50.1). The
//     empty kill is fail-closed: an invocation without --no-ext-diff errors
//     instead of executing the armed value; c0wrk's patch-producing diff
//     call sites pass --no-ext-diff, so their output stays usable.
//
//   - diff.<n>.command= (empty) per named external diff driver, which the
//     git diff porcelain likewise executes by default for paths routed to
//     it via the diff attribute. The per-key empty kill is the whole story:
//     -c beats file config wherever the driver is defined, so every routing
//     source — in-tree .gitattributes, info/attributes,
//     core.attributesFile — is closed without attr.tree ([56]).
//
//   - the transport keys the Git panel's remote RPCs reach:
//     core.sshCommand=ssh restores the default ssh binary for ssh://
//     remotes (an empty value aborts the fetch with "cannot run :" —
//     "ssh" keeps remote operations working); core.askPass= disables the
//     askpass helper; credential.helper= (empty) resets the accumulated
//     helper list — an empty value resets, and the -c layer is read after
//     every file, so the reset lands after all file-configured helpers —
//     plus a per-URL credential.<url>.helper= pin as belt-and-braces
//     against url-match normalization subtleties.
//
// Only core.pager and core.worktree produce no -c override: the pager is
// never spawned on a terminal (c0wrk always pipes git output), and the
// worktree key cannot be beaten by -c at all — GitCmdInRepo neutralizes it
// through the GIT_WORK_TREE env pin when the finding is present. The
