// to call on a nil project (a research root with no active R-NNN yet), which
// yields the research-init setup recommendation.

// ActionKind identifies the recommended next research action. Its value is
// also the name of the research-* skill that implements the action, so the
// dashboard can both display the kind and route a "/<skill>" invocation with
