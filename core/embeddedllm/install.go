// unavailable by step 1's probe and step 2's memory gate. That stop is bounded
// by StopTimeout when the caller set one; Remove's is bounded by the ctx its
// caller passes instead.
//
// The order is fixed and each step is a gate. The numbering starts at 1 because

// not one of the install's own gates:
//
//  1. hardware probe — RAM is a hard input (ErrRAMUnknown refuses);

//     directory and downloads nothing (ErrInsufficientMemory, naming both
//     pools with both numbers);
//  3. a whole-set disk guard, before the first byte is fetched;
//  4. port allocation, persisted in both the manifest and the config;
//  5. the runtime archives (and the Windows CUDA companion): download with
//     resume and per-component progress → SHA256 verification gate → extract
//     into a staging tree;
//  6. runtime provisioning: quarantine-clear + ad-hoc codesign on macOS, then
//     a --version smoke test on EVERY platform, all against the staged tree —
//     before the weights, so an unrunnable runtime (Gatekeeper, missing CUDA
//     12 libraries) fails in seconds instead of after a multi-gigabyte
//     download;
//  7. the staged runtime replaces the previous one — the old tree is retired
//     only after every new byte is secured and proven to run;
//  8. the weights (model, mmproj): download → SHA256 verification gate,
//     straight to their final paths;
//  9. manifest.json, written atomically and only now;
//
// 10. the config sink, which registers the provider entry.
//
// A failure at any step leaves no manifest and registers no provider: a
// half-installed model is never visible to the router. Bytes that DID verify
