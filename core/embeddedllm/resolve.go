// rather than delegating to the runtime's fit pass, so the plan still carries a
// concrete context to persist.
//
// `Topology` is what turns the resolution into a MEASURED one. When it is present
// the gate and the planner spend the machine's real device and host budgets,
// which is the whole point of the probe — an 8 GiB laptop with a 24 GiB card and
// a 128 GiB unified machine stop being ranked by a number that describes neither
