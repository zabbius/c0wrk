//     feature exists for. The budget transport (which wraps each provider's
//     HTTP client) instead reports the winning attempt's own duration through
//     the context recorder this caller installs, so a retried call is measured
//     by the attempt that actually succeeded.
//   - When a request takes the transport's pass-through path (a caller-owned
//     deadline), no recorder is filled and this caller falls back to its own

// host. sharedClient is the router-level LLM client, so a pinned client
// inherits the LLM request timeout.
//
// While the proxy dials, the entry deliberately leaves HTTPClient nil rather
// than carrying the proxy client: nil makes the SDK fall back to
// RouterConfig.HTTPClient, which already has the proxy transport AND the long
// LLM timeout. Attaching the raw proxy client here would shadow it and cap
// every inference request at the much shorter web-fetch proxy timeout. See

//
// logger (may be nil) flows to llmtls for its malformed-pin and

// The embedded provider's ensure-loaded transport (embedded) is the SECOND
// resolver on this hook, and the order is fixed: the pin rule decides whether
// the entry carries a client at all, and the embedded transport only decorates
// that decision (embedding it first would hand llmtls a client whose transport
// is a wrapper, which cannot hold a tls.Config). Both resolvers clone from
// sharedClient, so whichever applies, timeouts.llmRequestTimeout survives.
//
// The same guard is also the ONLY thing that sets ProviderEntry.ReasoningWire
// and ProviderEntry.OmitReasoningHistory: the embedded llama-server spells
// Qwen reasoning controls as chat_template_kwargs (while every other
// openai_compatible entry keeps the vendor-default top-level spelling), and
// its chat template rejects the reasoning_content history echo the DeepSeek
// V4 contract adds to every assistant request message — so that entry alone
// opts out of the echo while every other entry keeps it.
//
// The adaptive budget wiring (ADR-071) sits BETWEEN those two resolvers: its
// RoundTripper wraps the client's transport on top of the pin and beneath the
// ensure-loaded gate. When it is enabled, the entry clone carries
// Client.Timeout = 0 — arming is the budget transport's ALWAYS-ARM, which is
// also what keeps the embedded entry's post-readiness budget from capping a

// posture shared by every session: a runtime deny set in the security
// settings UI must reach already-open sessions too, otherwise it would
// silently fail-open on every session created before the save (the same
// save's execute blocklist does reach them, because it re-registers the tool
// in the shared sp4rk registry the clones embed). The autonomy posture, by
// contrast, is pinned per task: each clone inherits it at creation and

// resume path) via ToolRegistry.RefreshAutonomyPosture, so a task that
// started interactive can never silently turn unattended mid-run, and a

// currently sees in Settings. The pinning is bidirectional-aware: the
// escalation direction is pinned as just described, while a TIGHTENING save
// (a revocation to a less-permissive posture — e.g. Security back to
// Assisted/Standard while a silent task runs) must not fail open, so each
// live clone also receives ApplyAutonomyPostureIfTightening, which applies
// the new posture only when it is tighter than the clone's current one. The
// result is that a task can never silently BECOME unattended mid-run, but a
// revocation reaches a running task immediately. applySecurityPolicies also

// availability is tool-registration-scoped and therefore follows Settings
