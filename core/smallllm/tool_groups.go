// ToolGroupDef describes a functional cluster of orchestration tools offered by
// the always-present picker (settings UI). The picker presents the cluster as a
// single entry that pins every member at once, so a workflow is never added
// only in part — e.g. the plan-step tool without the plan-declaration tool.
// (Individual members can still be removed one chip at a time afterwards; the
// guarantee is about how a cluster is added.)
//
// The catalog is static data (no registry access); every member name is a
// built-in tool the backend validates against the live registry before the
// cluster reaches the UI.
type ToolGroupDef struct {
	// ID is a stable, URL-safe cluster identifier.
	ID string
	// Title is the human-readable cluster name shown in the picker.
	Title string
	// Description explains the capability the cluster grants the agent; the
	// picker renders it (alongside the member list) in the entry's tooltip.
	Description string
	// Tools are the member tool names, in display order. All members are
	// listed in the picker's tooltip; selecting the cluster pins each member
	// that is still selectable.
	Tools []string
}

// toolGroupCatalog is the ordered workflow-cluster catalog. It groups only the
// tools that are useless in isolation — the planning and subagent/reflection
// workflows — so the picker can offer them atomically. Capability areas whose
// tools stand alone (files, search, web, memory, shell) are deliberately left
// ungrouped and offered individually: narrowing a read-only agent to file reads
// without file writes is a legitimate choice.
//
// Goal-mode tools (propose_goal, declare_goal_status, declare_verification) have
// no cluster and are excluded from the picker universe entirely: they are never
// narrowable (they are stripped from every non-goal run before the selection
// runs, and the selection is not applied in goal mode), so a cluster around them
// would be an inert control. See backend/frontend_api_config.go builtinToolInfos.
