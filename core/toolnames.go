// FileMutatingTools is the set of tool names that can modify files on disk.

// tool (`bash_exec` on Unix, `posh_exec` on Windows — mutually exclusive per
// host) is included because it can mutate files in ways the in-process
// write_file/edit_file tools cannot (e.g. sed, git checkout, build artifacts),
// and the file watcher alone may miss some of those changes.
//
// Cost note: the resulting debounced incremental pass is NOT free even when no
// files changed — ValidateCollection reads and hashes every indexable file in
// the workspace (O(files) disk/CPU). The 1s debounce coalesces rapid bursts
// (e.g. a batch of edits) but NOT isolated bash_exec calls (each test run, git
// status, or build triggers one full sweep). For large repos this is non-
// trivial churn on a hot path. The tradeoff (freshness of search results after
// shell-driven changes) is considered worth the per-call O(files) sweep;
// revisit if profiling shows indexer pressure during heavy coding sessions.

// (the subsystem stays off for No Project sessions), so a query would either
// fail or return stale results from the previous CODE-mode project. ripgrep
// and glob were historically disabled here as "code-oriented" tools, but CHAT
// sessions legitimately use them beyond code (OS config, DevOps, dotfiles),
// so they are now allowed under the normal security.groups policies.
//
// Note: edit_file and write_file are intentionally NOT in this list. In No Project
// (CHAT) mode, write/edit operations are constrained to the per-session isolated
// workspace or temp directory by the Judge layer (judgeWriteInSessionRoots). This
// enables editing arbitrary files within the session workspace (including
// .c0wrk/plans/ for Plan Review) without exposing the broader filesystem. CHAT
// mode was never strictly read-only — bash_exec has always been allowed for
// session-scoped command execution.
