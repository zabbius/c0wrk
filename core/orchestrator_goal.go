// deriveGoal runs a full-context Conductor pass whose only job is to derive a
// crisp {condition, verify} goal from the user's message and submit it for
// user sign-off via propose_goal. It reuses the entire Conductor toolset
// (read/search/probe tools) so the agent grounds the goal in the actual
// codebase, but swaps in the specialized derivation system prompt and injects
// a GoalProposer that captures the agent's proposal.
//
// The flow:
//  1. Wrap deps.goalProposer in a capturingProposer (records the agent's
//     proposal + the user's response) and inject it into the Conductor ctx.
//  2. Ensure the propose_goal tool is exposed to the agent.
//  3. Override the Conductor system prompt with the derivation prompt.
//  4. Run the Conductor (reusing all wiring — context injection, trajectory,
//     tool executor/registry).
//  5. Build a GoalState from the captured approved response (preferring the
//     user's edits over the agent's original wording).
//
// Returns the approved (possibly user-edited) GoalState, or an error if the
// agent never proposed, the user cancelled, or the run failed before a

// defaultGoalVerifier is the production independent verifier. It runs an
// ISOLATED Conductor pass that reuses all wiring (context injection,
// trajectory, tool executor/registry) and inherits the active skills +
// project-context prefix via the goal-verification system prompt override
// (buildSpecializedSystemPrompt). The pass is bounded by the same
// complexity-derived budget as a normal executor run
// (complexity × stepsPerComplexity); the verifier reports its structured
// verdict through declare_verification into a fresh memVerificationSink injected
// into the per-pass context.
//
// ISOLATION + WORK-PRODUCT: it runs on a FRESH blackboard
// (orchestration.NewMapBlackboard), NOT the goal loop's blackboard, so it is a
// genuinely separate execution context with no leak of the still-active goal
// task's incomplete state. It is seeded with lastTurnOutput (the met turn's
// work product) via SetFinalResult, so the verifier's own read_final_result
// returns the real work — eliminating the "no final result recorded" symptom
// that arose when a fresh-context verifier could not reach the goal task's
// output. The reported-evidence injection (renderReportedEvidence into the
// directive) is kept as before; it is blackboard-independent.
//
// MODE BRANCHING: the directive + toolset are selected by gs.VerificationMode.
//   - executable (default): prompts.GoalVerification directive + verifierToolFilter
//     (read-only/test). The agent independently re-runs the verify clause.
//   - re_derivation: prompts.GoalReDerivation directive + verifierReDerivationToolFilter
//     (read-only/test PLUS delegate; read_step_output is already present via
//     the system group in both modes). The agent delegates a
//     fresh read-only run of the goal's process and confirms only if it comes
//     back clean.
//
// Both modes withhold every mutating tool and every goal-control tool (except
// delegate in re_derivation). A pass that ends WITHOUT declaring a verdict
// (nil sink) is treated as a REJECT — the condition could not be independently
// confirmed (e.g. the pass hit the step budget or errored before declaring).
