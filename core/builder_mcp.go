// ReconfigureMCP reconfigures the MCP gateway with the given config.
// If no gateway exists, starts a new one.
//
// Note: MCP startup (runMCPInit) is decoupled from initDone, so this method
// waits on mcpDone — NOT initDone — to guarantee the initial gateway assignment
// has completed before reading/acting on b.gateway. Otherwise a Reconfigure
// arriving during the first ~seconds of startup could observe b.gateway == nil
// and start a duplicate gateway that races with runMCPInit.
//
// LOCKING: b.mu is NEVER held across the gateway work below, only around the
// snapshot and the publication. Both Reconfigure and StartGateway connect to
// MCP servers over the network, and a single unreachable endpoint can hold
// them for minutes — a previously-failed HTTP server is retried on every
// Reconfigure, silently and with no deadline of its own. b.mu sits on the
// GetConfig path (GetConfig takes configMu.RLock, then b.mu.RLock via
// ModelRegistry), so holding the write lock across that work convoys every
// config reader behind it and freezes the whole settings dialog for the
// duration. Dropping b.mu costs nothing in consistency: the gateway
// serializes concurrent Reconfigure calls on its own mutex, and reconfigureMu
// below serializes this method.

// It intentionally does NOT wait on mcpDone: SetDefaultWorkDir is a pure field
// write on the gateway and needs no network, so blocking here would serialise
// this cheap call behind the (potentially multi-second) MCP server discovery
// that runMCPInit performs. Both this method and runMCPInit take b.mu, so they
// are serialised and the last writer of mcpWorkDir wins — for BOTH the recorded
