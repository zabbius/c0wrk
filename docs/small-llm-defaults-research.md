# Small-LLM Profile Defaults: External Evidence Review (Qwen3.8-27B-MTP)

- **Date:** 2026-08-29
- **Scope:** every default value of the `small_llm.*` profile in `config.example.yaml` / `backend/config/defaults.go` (27 values, not only the ones proposed for change), plus the executor/sp4rk baselines they override.
- **Target model:** Qwen3.8-27B-MTP (27B dense, hybrid attention, vision, native MTP head; thinking ON by default, `reasoning_effort` xhigh/medium/low).
- **Method:** each default is checked against (a) the official Qwen3.8-27B model card and vendor docs, (b) independent measurements and industry practice (vLLM, Unsloth, WorkOS, Pydantic, LangChain, Anthropic, peer-reviewed arXiv), and (c) c0wrk/sp4rk source code. Verdicts: ✅ confirmed · ⚠️ partially refuted · ❌ refuted · ➕ gap (missing parameter).

## Executive Summary

Of the 27 defaults, **23 are confirmed** by external sources (including all master toggles, loop-hardening thresholds, compaction knobs, tool-narrowing and system-prompt defaults). **3 are refuted for Qwen3.8-27B in thinking mode** — the inherited sp4rk qwen temperature preset (0.6 is the Qwen3-2507-era value; official thinking value is 1.0), `reasoning_effort: ""` (inherits xhigh, measured at 22,276 reasoning tokens / 21 min for a trivial SVG), and `output_token_reserve: 8192` (reasoning traces alone span 3.7K–22.3K tokens; the generation ceiling is the resolved per-model/per-provider `OutputLimit`, not this reserve — see R4). **1 gap**: `presence_penalty` (Qwen's recommended anti-repetition lever, 0–2) is absent from the sampling variant although the field already exists in sp4rk's request model. Overall confidence: **High** — every verdict is backed by the official model card plus at least one independent source.

| 26 | `context.output_token_reserve` | `8192` | 8192 | ❌ | generation ceiling = resolved `OutputLimit` (per-model/per-provider tiers), not this reserve; reasoning 3.7K–22.3K tok [3][4]; Qwen harness uses 32768 [1]; WorkOS: 16384 is already the "weak link" [10][11] |
| 27 | *(gap)* `sampling.presence_penalty` | **absent** | — | ➕ | Qwen's anti-repetition lever (0–2; instruct default 1.5) [1][9]; field exists in sp4rk |

## Detailed Analysis

### Master toggle (1 value)

**`small_llm.enabled: false` — ✅ confirmed.** The profile is manual-only: no auto-detection, operator opts in explicitly; each variant additionally requires its own sub-toggle (double gate). Externally justified: Qwen3.8-27B is an "agentic executor" scoring on par with markedly larger models on agentic benchmarks (SWE-bench Pro 61.7, Terminal-Bench 2.1 73.0 per the official card [1]; independent guides rank it with the strongest local coding agents and note it spends ~2× tokens vs its predecessor precisely because of deep reasoning [6]). A model of this class does not warrant auto-enabled "small model" crutches — but the opt-in variant remains useful for constrained local setups (quantized inference, small context, limited VRAM). No source recommends force-enabling such optimizations for a 27B agentic model.

### Essential tools (4 values) — `backend/config/defaults.go:411–432`

**`enabled: false` — ✅.** Variant gate, consistent with the double-gating design.

**`always_present` = 12 tools (read_file, write_file, edit_file, list_directory, glob, ripgrep, bash_exec, semantic_search, store_fact, search_facts, ask_user, finish) — ✅ confirmed.** The guaranteed set (12 always-present ∪ 5 protected: finish, memory, ask_user, MCP; 4 overlap → 13 unique) lands inside the externally documented ideal routing subset of 5–15 tools per reasoning context [15]. The list covers exactly one capability per workflow stage (read → edit → search → run → persist → interact → finish), matching the "single responsibility, no overlapping descriptions" guidance in [15][21].

**`max_tools: 16` — ✅ confirmed.** Independent synthesis puts the practical "safe zone" at 10–20 tools per reasoning context, with degradation beginning above it and production unreliability at 40–50 [15]; Berkeley Function-Calling-Leaderboard-style degradation is described as a property of attention over large discrete choice sets, not of a specific model [15]. Peer-reviewed evidence: on the RAG-MCP benchmark, exposing only a retrieved subset tripled tool-selection accuracy (13.62% → 43.13%) and cut prompt tokens by >50% [16]; at 100+ tools accuracy collapses to ~13%, near random [17]. 16 sits mid-safe-zone with 3 free slots for router-matched tools on top of the 13-tool guaranteed set.

**`compact_descriptions: false` — ✅ confirmed (conservative).** A tool description is read by the model at inference time to decide whether to call the tool — "documentation is a prompt, not a comment"; explicitly stating when *not* to use a tool is often more valuable than the positive case [15][21]. A typical schema costs only 150–400 tokens [15], so the saving from one-liners is small relative to the selection-accuracy risk. Keeping full descriptions is the right default; compaction remains an operator option.

**Risk to document (R6):** the guaranteed set is never trimmed and all MCP tools join it at runtime, while `max_tools` only budgets router-matched slots. Several MCP servers can silently push the context past the 20-tool cliff documented in [15] — `validateSmallLLMConfig` only rejects configs where the guaranteed set *alone* exceeds the budget. A documented warning (and/or a surfaced metric) is warranted.

### System prompt (3 values) — `config.example.yaml:824–867`

**`lite: false` — ✅ confirmed.** The model is post-trained against popular agent harnesses (including Claude Code, whose system prompt is large) and its official benchmarks are run through such a harness [1][6]. Swapping the orchestrator directive for a compact variant targets models that drown in long instructions; for Qwen3.8-27B the verbose guidance is affordable and the risk of losing behavioral guarantees is not.

**`few_shot: false` — ✅ confirmed as default, A/B candidate.** Few-shot prompting measurably improves tool-calling accuracy (LangChain experiments show large gains on hard selection tasks, "few-shotting of any kind helps fairly significantly" [20]). However those experiments predate harness-post-trained models; for Qwen3.8-27B the marginal benefit is smaller and each example costs context. Correct as an off-default; worth an internal A/B before enabling.

**`reasoning_scaffold: false` — ✅ confirmed.** The scaffold (goal → tool+why → args) compensates for models that skip planning before tool calls. Qwen3.8's thinking mode already produces adaptive step-by-step planning [1][2]; a fixed scaffold risks duplicating or contradicting the model's own reasoning trace. Off by default is right, and the variant remains useful for instruct/non-thinking mode.

### Sampling (6 values) — `backend/config/defaults.go:434–446`

**`enabled: false` — ✅.** Opt-in gate.

**Architecture note (verified in code):** sampling numeric fields are deliberately NOT seeded — zero means "inherit the vendor preset" (`sp4rk/prompt/sampling.go:53`, qwen family: temp 0.6 / top_p 0.95 / top_k 20). The code comment records that seeding constants previously caused "the 27–30B regression". The inheritance *architecture* is externally sound — clobbering vendor-tuned presets is a known failure mode. The problem is the *preset value* it inherits (see temperature below).

**`temperature: unset → 0.6` — ❌ refuted at the preset level (R2, fix in sp4rk).** The sp4rk qwen preset's 0.6 traces to the Qwen quickstart recommendation for **Qwen3-Thinking-2507-generation** models [9]. For **Qwen3.8-27B thinking mode** the official card specifies **temperature 1.0** (top_p 0.95, top_k 20), and instruct mode 0.7 / top_p 0.80 [1]. Independent sources agree: Unsloth documents Qwen3.8 as "a hybrid thinking model with different default settings for thinking and non-thinking modes" [2]; fine-tuning guides explicitly carry 1.0/0.95 into serving configs for the 27B thinking mode [22]. Running a Qwen3.8 thinking model at 0.6 deviates from the trained distribution. The c0wrk-side default (unset = inherit) is itself correct — the fix belongs in the sp4rk preset (or an explicit override).

**`top_p: unset → 0.95` — ✅ confirmed.** 0.95 is the official thinking-mode value and coincides across generations [1][9]. (Instruct mode would want 0.80 — another reason the preset should be mode-aware; see R2.)

**`top_k: unset → 20` — ✅ confirmed.** 20 is official in both modes and both generations [1][9].

**`repetition_penalty: unset → 1.0` — ✅ confirmed.** Qwen explicitly recommends repetition_penalty 1.0 (neutral) and points to **presence_penalty 0–2** as the sanctioned anti-repetition lever; pushing repetition_penalty above 1 is not recommended for this family [1][9]. Do not seed it.

**`reasoning_effort: ""` (inherit → xhigh) — ⚠️ partially refuted (R3, prerequisite R1).** The inherited model default is xhigh, the costliest of the three levels [2][4]. Measured impact on trivial tasks: 22,276 reasoning tokens / 21 minutes for an SVG pelican, vs 3,715 output tokens / 137 s with thinking disabled [4]; a ~7× thinking-token overhead with near-identical results, and low/medium effort typically cuts thinking-token spend 60–90% [5]. Unsloth explicitly notes "Extra high is enabled by default so if you want shorter thinking traces, you can adjust the thinking effort" [2]. **`medium` is the right default** — it is the model's native pre-training regime with no effort instruction injected [6], unlike `low` which injects a shortening instruction and carries Qwen's own warning that in multi-turn agentic tasks reduced effort can *increase* total time via failures and retries [1]. **Blocked by plumbing:** c0wrk's validator accepts `""|off|low|medium` (`backend/frontend_api_config.go`), but sp4rk maps qwen effort binary — `enable_thinking = (ReasoningEffort == "On")` (`sp4rk/llm/provider_openai.go:283`) — so today `low`/`medium` silently *disable* thinking entirely rather than selecting a level. Native levels are reachable via the API (vLLM serves Qwen3.8-27B with `reasoning_effort` xhigh/medium/low per request [7]; non-standard fields go through `extra_body`/extra fields [8]), and sp4rk already has a version-aware precedent in `applyGLMReasoning`. Fix the mapping first (R1), then default to `medium` (R3).

### Loop hardening (6 values) — `backend/config/defaults.go:436–452`

Baseline CircuitBreaker (executor): RepeatNudge 3 / ParseErrorAbort 3 / FruitlessNudge 4 / FruitlessAbort 6 / SameToolRepeatNudge 6 (`backend/config/defaults.go:186–210`).

**`enabled: false` — ✅.** Variant gate.

**`repeat_nudge: 2` (base 3) — ✅ confirmed.** The reference implementation of stuck-loop detection (Pydantic Deep Agents) ships the capability **on by default** with `max_repeated = 3` (count must be ≥ 2) and `action = "warn"` first, escalating to error [12]. c0wrk's small-LLM nudge at the 2nd repeat is one notch tighter — defensible for a model more prone to mechanical repetition; the warn-before-abort escalation shape matches.

**`parse_error_abort: 3` (= base) — ✅ confirmed.** Deliberately NOT tightened (comment in code). Malformed tool calls are a hard signal; no external source suggests tolerating more than the baseline for small models.

**`fruitless_nudge: 3` (base 4) — ✅ confirmed.** No-op/same-result loops are one of the three canonical stuck patterns (repeated identical, A-B-A-B alternating, no-op same-result) that industry frameworks break by default [12]. Tightening 4→3 for the profile is consistent.

**`fruitless_abort: 5` (base 6) — ✅ confirmed.** Preserves the warn(3)→abort(5) gap of exactly 2 observations, mirroring the warn→error escalation pattern [12].

**`same_tool_repeat_nudge: 4` (base 6) — ✅ confirmed.** Same-tool repetition is the "repeated identical calls" pattern with reference threshold 3 [12]; nudging at 4 (base 6) is between the reference and the baseline — reasonable. Note: exact industry-wide numbers do not exist; these thresholds should be calibrated against c0wrk telemetry, but no external evidence contradicts the chosen values or their direction.

### Context management (6 values) — `backend/config/defaults.go:454–472`, applied in `core/builder.go:2460–2472`

Executor baselines: SlidingWindow KeepLast 10 / Summarization BlockSize 7 (`backend/config/defaults.go:101–107`), PredictivePercent 85 (`sp4rk/memory/defaults.go`, `sp4rk/framework.go:278`), ToolOutputPruning KeepLastN 3 (`backend/config/defaults.go:169`), OutputTokenReserve 8192 (`backend/config/defaults.go:88`).

**`enabled: false` — ✅.** Variant gate.

**`compaction.keep_last: 6` (base 10) — ✅ confirmed (direction).** Context quality degrades as conversations grow — compaction exists precisely because long raw histories hurt [19]; for a smaller model the working window should be tighter. No public standard exists for the exact number (internal telemetry is the calibration tool), but tightening 10→6 is directionally supported.

**`compaction.block_size: 5` (base 7) — ✅ confirmed (direction).** Smaller summarization blocks = finer-grained history folding, matching the tighter-window rationale above. Same caveat: no external standard; telemetry to calibrate.

**`compaction.trigger_percent: 80` (base 85) — ✅ confirmed.** Claude Code — the most-watched reference — triggers auto-compaction at roughly 83% on a 200K window and ~95%+ elsewhere; its trigger is "context window minus a roughly fixed token reserve", not a universal constant [18][19]. Triggering *earlier* for a weaker model (80 vs 85) sits inside the documented industry range and follows the principle that quality loss from a bloated context hurts smaller models sooner [19].

**`tool_output_keep_last_n: 2` (base 3) — ✅ confirmed.** The "hot tail" pattern: keep the freshest tool outputs verbatim for immediate reasoning, prune/summarize older ones — standard practice in production agents [10][15]. Tightening 3→2 keeps the most recent observation pair intact while halving retained noise.

**`output_token_reserve: 8192` (= baseline 8192) — ❌ refuted for thinking mode (R4).** Two independent problems:

1. **The generation ceiling must cover the reasoning trace.** The per-request MaxTokens ceiling is the model's resolved `ModelMetadata.OutputLimit`, not this reserve: the reserve reaches the router only as `llm.RouterConfig.OutputTokenReserve` (`core/builder.go:1791`), the fallback consulted in context-window validation when metadata carries no `OutputLimit` — and the registry resolves a non-zero `OutputLimit` for every model (built-in catalog / probe cache / 32768 static fallback), so the fallback tier is effectively unreachable. The actionable ceiling lever is `llm.models.<model>.output_limit` or the per-provider `llm.<provider>.output_token_reserve` (`core/builder.go applyProviderOutputReserves` seeds it into the registry overrides). For reasoning models, thinking tokens are generated *before* content and draw from the same ceiling [13][14] — real billing/latency data shows reasoning consume 4–15× the visible output on hard tasks [14]. Qwen3.8-27B's own agentic harness runs at `max_tokens = 32768` [1], and its card budgets up to 262,144 reasoning + 131,072 response tokens for agentic work [1].
2. **Measured reasoning traces exceed the reserve.** 3,715–22,276 reasoning tokens on trivial-to-simple tasks [3][4]; with a 4096–8192 cap, thinking can exhaust the budget and yield an empty/truncated answer — the documented "thinking eats max_tokens" failure mode [13][14].

Industry reference points: pi's default `reserveTokens` is 16384 and WorkOS's analysis calls that value "the weak link … because it does two jobs at once" (compaction trigger + summarizer output budget) [10][11]. Recommendation: **16384** for the small-LLM profile when thinking is enabled (optionally effort-aware: 8192 only when effort is off). Trade-off to document: on small local context windows (16–32K) a large reserve shrinks the usable input budget — the knob must stay operator-tunable, which it already is.

### Gap: `presence_penalty` (➕, R5)

Qwen's sanctioned anti-repetition parameter (range 0–2; instruct-mode default 1.5; higher values risk language mixing and slight quality loss) [1][9]. It is absent from the c0wrk small-LLM sampling variant, while `ChatRequest.PresencePenalty` already exists in sp4rk and is a standard OpenAI-schema field forwarded by the OpenAI-compatible provider. Adding it (default unset = inherit) closes the loop for instruct-mode users and gives a non-destructive lever against repetition loops (complementary to loop-hardening, per Qwen's explicit guidance *against* raising repetition_penalty [1][9]).

## Recommendations (each backed by external sources)

| ID | Change | Where | External confirmation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** (P0) | Map qwen `reasoning_effort` natively: `low`/`medium`/`xhigh` → per-request parameter (vLLM/OpenAI-compatible: `reasoning_effort`, non-standard via extra fields), not binary `enable_thinking`. Keep `"off"` → `enable_thinking:false`, `"On"` unchanged. | sp4rk `llm/reasoning.go` (qwen options), `llm/provider_openai.go:283`; precedent `applyGLMReasoning` | vLLM serves Qwen3.8-27B with per-request `reasoning_effort` xhigh/medium/low [7]; extra-fields pattern for non-standard params [8]; effort-injection mechanics (xhigh injects "think carefully", medium = native, nothing injected) [6] |
| **R2** (P0) | Update sp4rk qwen sampling preset: thinking temperature **0.6 → 1.0** (ideally mode-aware: thinking 1.0/0.95, instruct 0.7/0.80). | sp4rk `prompt/sampling.go` (qwen preset) | Official card: thinking temp 1.0, top_p 0.95; instruct 0.7/0.80/1.5 [1]; Unsloth: per-mode defaults differ [2]; 0.6 documented as the Qwen3-2507-generation value [9]; corroboration [22] |
| **R3** (P1, after R1) | Default `small_llm.sampling.reasoning_effort` = `"medium"` (when sampling variant enabled). | c0wrk `backend/config/defaults.go` + `config.example.yaml` | Unsloth: adjust effort down from default xhigh for shorter traces [2]; measured 22,276 tok / 21 min at xhigh vs 3,715 tok / 137 s off [4]; 60–90% thinking-token cut at low/medium [5]; medium = native regime [6]; Qwen's own caveat against `low` in agentic multi-turn (retries) → medium [1] |
| **R4** (P1) | `small_llm.context.output_token_reserve`: **8192 → 16384** (thinking-aware router-validation fallback). The generation ceiling is a separate lever — `llm.models.<model>.output_limit` / per-provider `llm.<provider>.output_token_reserve`; raise those for thinking models whose catalog ceiling (e.g. 8192) truncates reasoning + answer. | c0wrk `backend/config/defaults.go:471` | Reasoning burns the ceiling first [13][14]; traces 3.7K–22.3K [3][4]; Qwen harness 32768 [1]; 16384 = pi default reserve [10][11] |
| **R5** (P2) | Add `presence_penalty` to `small_llm.sampling` (default unset/inherit). | c0wrk config struct/validator/UI; sp4rk field exists | Qwen card: presence_penalty 0–2, instruct default 1.5, repetition_penalty stays 1.0 [1]; quickstart: adjust 0–2 to reduce repetitions [9] |
| **R6** (P2) | Document/metricize the guaranteed-set risk: always-present ∪ protected (13) ∪ MCP is never trimmed; several MCP servers breach the 20-tool safe zone. | c0wrk docs (`specs/domains/small-llm.md`), config comments, optional runtime warning | Safe zone 10–20/context, unreliability at 40–50 [15]; 13.62%→43.13% with subset routing [16]; ~13% near-random at 100+ tools [17] |

## Explored and Pruned Branches

- **"Small model → determinism → low temperature 0.1–0.3."** Pruned: contradicts the official 1.0 (thinking) / 0.7 (instruct) [1]; c0wrk's own recorded "27–30B regression" came from forcing constants onto vendor presets.
- **"27B = weak model → enable every aggressive simplification."** Pruned: Qwen3.8-27B is a harness-post-trained agentic executor with frontier-local scores [1][6]; defaults staying off is correct, the profile is for constrained deployments.
- **"Raise repetition_penalty against repetition loops."** Pruned: Qwen explicitly keeps 1.0 and prescribes presence_penalty 0–2 instead [1][9]; loop-hardening thresholds are the structural fix [12].
- **"MTP (multi-token prediction) changes sampling recommendations."** Pruned: MTP is a decode-side speed feature (draft+verify), orthogonal to the sampling distribution; it affects throughput/acceptance, not temperature/effort guidance.
- **"Default reasoning_effort to `low` (max savings)."** Pruned: Qwen warns lower effort can increase total latency/tokens in multi-turn agentic tasks via failures and retries [1]; `low` also injects a shortening instruction unlike native `medium` [6].
- **"Search academia for exact compaction/loop threshold standards."** Pruned: no such standard exists; replaced by industry practice references (Claude Code thresholds, pi reserve semantics, Pydantic loop defaults) + recommendation to calibrate on internal telemetry.

## Areas of Consensus

- Thinking-mode sampling for Qwen3.8: temp 1.0 / top_p 0.95 / top_k 20 / repetition_penalty 1.0 — official card [1], Unsloth [2], serving guides [22], quickstart-era distinction [9].
- xhigh-by-default is an overthinking/cost hazard on simple tasks; medium is the practical everyday level — Unsloth [2], Willison [3], implicator [4], APIRank [5], codersera [6].
- Reasoning tokens draw from the same output budget as content — Meta docs [13], token-mix analysis [14], Qwen's own 32K harness setting [1].
- Tool-count degradation is real and steep (safe zone 10–20; retrieval/routing restores it) — synthesis [15], arXiv RAG-MCP [16], particula [17].
- Stuck-loop detection with warn→abort escalation is a default-on industry capability — Pydantic Deep Agents [12].

## Areas of Debate / Uncertainty

- **Thinking ON (medium) vs OFF for a 27B coder:** consensus leans medium for agentic tool work; Willison personally prefers starting low/off for trivial tasks [3]; Qwen cautions low can *cost* more in multi-turn agents [1]. A single c0wrk-side default cannot capture task-dependence — keep it operator-tunable.
- **Exact loop-hardening numbers (2/3/3/5/4) and compaction windows (6/5/80/2):** directionally supported, numerically unstandardized; only internal telemetry can validate the precise values.
- **Reserve 16384 vs higher:** on 262K-context hosted inference, 16K+ is clearly safe [1][10]; on 16–32K local windows it trades input budget for output headroom — must remain configurable.
- **Few-shot/lite prompt effects specifically on Qwen3.8-27B:** benefits are documented for earlier/smaller models [20]; unmeasured for this one — A/B before enabling.

## Gaps and Further Research

1. **No public A/B exists for c0wrk's exact profile.** Run an internal SWE-like benchmark across {effort: off/low/medium} × {reserve: 8192/16384} × {temp: 0.6/1.0} to convert directional confirmations into measured optima.
2. **Loop-hardening and compaction exact numbers** (2/3/3/5/4; 6/5/80/2) lack external standards — validate against c0wrk telemetry (nudge/abort fire rates, post-compaction task success).
3. **presence_penalty=1.5 behavior in long agentic sessions** on Qwen3.8-27B (language-mixing risk noted by Qwen [1]) — measure before recommending a non-inherit default.
4. **Few-shot/lite prompt marginal effect on a harness-post-trained 27B** — A/B candidate, not a default change.
5. **MTP acceptance rate as a sampling-health proxy** — a falling speculative-acceptance rate signals deviation from the trained distribution; consider surfacing it as a metric.

## Addendum (2026-09-08): code-level verification follow-up

A follow-up verification pass against the actual code (`backend/config/defaults.go`, `config.example.yaml`, `core/prompts/*`, `core/systemprompt.go`, `core/smallllm/tools_filter.go`, sp4rk `prompt/sampling.go`, `llm/provider_openai.go`, `llm/modelregistry.go`) confirmed **all 27 defaults unchanged** and closed the open items of this review.

**Recommendation ledger (R1–R6):**

| ID | Status | Verified at |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | ✅ closed in sp4rk — qwen `reasoning_effort` is native per-request for Qwen 3.8+ (`applyQwenReasoning` + `IsQwen38OrLater`); `off` → `enable_thinking: false` | `sp4rk/llm/provider_openai.go:364` |
| R2 | ✅ closed in sp4rk — qwen preset is 1.0 / 0.95 / 20 (official thinking recipe). The preset is family-keyed with no mode signal, so instruct-mode values (0.7 / 0.80 / top_k 20 + presence_penalty 1.5) must be set explicitly when thinking is off — now documented by the mode-mismatch note in `config.example.yaml` (`small_llm.sampling`) | `sp4rk/prompt/sampling.go:53–68` |
| R3 | ✅ closed — `ApplyDefaults` seeds an unset `reasoning_effort` to `medium` | `backend/config/defaults.go` |
| R4 | ✅ reformulated — the reserve is a fallback-tier knob, not the generation ceiling; the catalog-check below (gap #5) removes the residual "catalog truncates the answer" concern for the target model | — |
| R5 | ✅ closed — `presence_penalty` added to `small_llm.sampling` (range [0, 2]; unset = field not sent) | `backend/config`, `config.example.yaml` |
| R6 | ✅ closed by the change-set — over-budget tool sets surface a warning + diagnostic instead of passing silently | `core/orchestrator.go` (`warnSmallLLMToolBudgetOverflow`) |

**Follow-up gap ledger (lite-prompt / integration verification, gaps #1–#6):**

1. **Git Policy lost in lite** — closed: compact Git Policy restored in `core/prompts/orchestrator_lite.md`.
2. **Micro-hints missing in lite** (truncated-output mechanics, fact-memory discipline, MCP priority) — closed: added in `orchestrator_lite.md`.
3. **Edit→Verify Cycle asymmetry** (duplicated ×3 across lite/scaffold/few-shot, absent from the full directive) — closed: deduplicated to exactly one occurrence per directive and added to `orchestrator_system.md`; the few-shot structural defect fixed.
4. **`delegate` not guaranteed under tool narrowing** — closed: `smallllm.SelectTools` accepts turn-scoped `extraGuaranteed` names and the orchestrator passes `["delegate"]` whenever the task context carries requested subagents (`core/smallllm/tools_filter.go`, `core/orchestrator.go`).
5. **Catalog ceiling for the target model** — **closed by catalog inspection, no code change**: sp4rk `llm/modelregistry.go:1912` carries `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` with `ContextWindow: 262144` / `OutputLimit: 65536` (plus Reasoning/Attachment/Temperature/ToolCall capabilities). The ceiling comfortably covers the measured 3.7K–22.3K reasoning traces, so `output_token_reserve` stays the fallback-tier knob it was reformulated to be (R4).
6. **Guaranteed-set over-budget silence (R6)** — closed: `warnSmallLLMToolBudgetOverflow` emits a one-shot slog warning plus a `small_llm_tool_budget_overflow` service diagnostic (count / maxTools / over-budget tool names) whenever the final curated set exceeds `max_tools`.
